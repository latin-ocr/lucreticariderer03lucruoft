hcap of stones. Therefore bodies possess a power of moving in
proportion to their smallness and smoothness, and on the other
hand the greater weight and roughness bodies prove to have, the
more stable they are. Since then the nature of the mind has
been found to be eminently easy to‘ move, it must consist of
bodies exceedingly small smooth and round. Tho knowledge of
which fact, my good friend, will on many accounts prove useful
and be serviceable to you. The following fact too likewise demon-
strates how fine the texture is of which its nature is composed,
and how small the room is in which it can be contained, could it
only be collected into one mass: soon as the untroubled sleep of
death has gotten hold of a man and the nature of the mind and
soul has withdrawn, you can perceive then no diminution of the
entire body either in appearance or weight: death makes all good
save the vital sense and heat. Therefore the whole soul must
consist of very small seeds and be inwoven through veins and
flesh and sinews3 inasmuch as, after it has all withdrawn from
the whole body, the exterior contour of the limbs preserves itself
entire and not a tittle of the weight is lost. Just in the same
way when the flavour of wine is gone or when the delicious aroma
01 a perfume has been dispersed into the air or when the savour
has left some body, yet the thing itself does not therefore look
smaller to the eye, nor does aught seem to have been taken from
the weight, because sure enough many minute seeds make up
the savours and the odour in the whole body 01 the several
things. Therefore, again and again I say, you are to know that
the nature of the mind and the soul has been formed of exceed-
ingly minute seeds, since at its departure it takes away none of
the weight.

We are not however to suppose that this nature is single.
For a certain subtle spirit mixed with heat quits men at death,
and then the heat draws air along with it3 there being no heat
which has not air too mixed with it: for since its nature is rare,
many first-beginnings of air must move about through it. Thus
the nature of the mind is proved to be threefold3 and yet these
things all together are not sufficient to produce sense; since the
fact of the case does not admit that any of these can produce
sense-giving motions and the thoughts which a man turns over
in mind. Thus some fourth nature too must be added to these:
