hidden stings which stimulate to hurt even that whatever it 13
110111 which spring those germs of frcnzy. But Venus with light
hand breaks the force of these pains during love, and the fond
pleasure mingled therein reins in the bites. For 111 this there 13
hope, that from the same body whence springs their burning
desire, their flamc may likewise be quenched3 though nature
protests that the very opposite is the truth3 and this is the one
thing of all, in which, when we have most of it, then all the more
the breast burns with fell desire. Meat and drink arc taken into
the body3 and 03 they 0011 fill up certain fixed parts, in this way
the craving 101 drink and bread is easily satisfied3 but from the
face and beautiful bloom of man nothing is given into the body
to enjoy save flimsy idols3 a sorry hope which is often snatche‹l
off by the wind. As when in sleep a thirsty man seeks to drink
and water is not given to quench the burning in his frame, but 110
seeks the idols of waters and toils in vain and thirsts as hc drinks
in the midst of the torrent stream, thus in love Venus mocks lovers
with idols‚ nor can bodies satisfy them by all their 8021118Γ upon
them nor can they with their hands rub aught off tho soft limbs,
wandering undecided over the whole body. At last when they
have united and enjoy the flower of age, when tho body now has a
presage 01 delights and Venus 13 111 the mood to sow the fields of
woman, they greedily clasp 00011 other's body and suck each other's
lips and breathe in, pressing meanwhile teeth on each other's mouth3
all in vain, since they 0011 1111) nothing off nor enter and pass each
with 1113 whole body into the other's body3 for so sometimes they
seem to will and strive to do: 30 greedily are they held in the
chains of Venus, while their limbs melt overpowered by the might
of the pleasure. At length when the gathered desire 1103 gone
forth, there ensues for 0 brief while 0 short pause in the burning
passion3 and then returns the same frenzy, then comes back the
old madness, when they 010 at 0 1033 to know what they really
desire to get, and cannot find what device is to conquer that
misehief 3 in such utter uncertainty they pine away by a hidden
wound.

Then too they waste their strength and ruin themselves by
the labour, then too their life is passed at the beck of another.
