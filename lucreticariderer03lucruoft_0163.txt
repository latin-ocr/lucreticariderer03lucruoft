track we might arrive at it in a straightforward course3 he
shewed too what evils existed in mortal affairs throughout, rising
up and manifoldly flying about by a natural—call it chance or
force, because nature had so brought it about3 and from what
gates you must sally out duly to encounter each3 and he proved
- that mankind mostly without cause arouse in their breast the
melancholy tumbling billows of cares. For even as children are
flurried and dread all things in the thick darkness, thus we in the
daylight fear at times things not a whit more to be dreaded than
what children shudder at in the dark and fancy sure to be. This
terror therefore and darkness of mind must be dispelled not by the
rays of the sun and glittering shafts of day, but by the aspect and
law of nature. Wherefore the more readily I will go on in my
verses to complete the web of my design.

earth and in heaven, when often they are in anxious suspense of
mind, and which abase their souls with fear of the gods and weigh
and press them down to earth, because ignorance of the causes
constrains them to submit things to the empire of the gods and
to make over to them the kingdom. For they who have been
rightly taught that the gods lead a life without care, if never-
theless they wonder on what plan all things can be carried on,
above all in regard to those things which are seen overhead in the
ethereal borders, are borne back again into their old religious
scruples and take unto themselves hard taskmasters, whom they
poor wretches believe to be almighty, not knowing what can,
what cannot be, in short on what principle each thing has its
powers defined, its deep—set boundary mark3 and therefore they
