breathed flames from noisome mouth. It is plain however that
nothing of the sort is done, since we see that all things pro-
duced from fixed seeds and a fixed mother can in growing pre-
serve the marks of their kind. This you are to know must take
place after a fixecl law. For the particles suitable for each thing
from all kinds of food when inside the body pass into the frame
and joining on produce the appropriate motions; but on the
other hand we see nature throw out on the earth those that
are alien, and many things with their unseen bodies fly out of
the body impelled by blows: those I mean which have not been
able to join on to any part nor when inside to feel in unison
with and adopt the vital motions. But lest you haply suppose
that living things alone are bound by these conditionS, such a
law keeps all things within their limits. For even as things
begotten are in their whole nature all unlike one the other, thus
each must consist of first-beginnings of unlike shape3 not that
a scanty number are possessed of 3 like form, but because as a
rule they do not all resemble one the other. Again since the
seeds differ, there must be 3 difference in the spaces between,
the passages, the connexions, the weights, the blows, the 613511-
ings, the motions3 311 which not only disjoin living bodies, but
hold apart the lands and the whole sea, and keep all heaven
away from the earth.

Now mark, and apprehend precepts amassed by my welcome
toil, lest haply you (leem that those things which you see with
your eyes to be bright, because white are formed of white
principles, or that the things which are black are born from black
seed; or that things which are steeped in any other colour, bear
that colour because the bodies of matter are dyed with a colour
like to it. For the bodies of matter have no colour at all either
like to the things or unlike. But if haply it seems to you that
no impression of the mind can throw itself into these bodies, you
wandel· sar astray. For since men born blind who have never
beheld the light of the sun, yet recognise bodies by touch, though
linked with no colour for them from their first birth, you are to
know that bodies can fall under the ken of our mind too, though
stained with no colour. Again whatever things we ourselves
touch in the thick darkness, we do not perccive to be dyed with
any colour. And since I prove that this is the case, I will now
