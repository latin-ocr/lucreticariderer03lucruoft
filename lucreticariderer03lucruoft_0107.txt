when we press it out in chewing our food, in the same way as
when one haply begins to squeeze with his hand and dry a spongo
full of water. Next the whole of what we press out distributes
115611ἱ through the cavities of the palate and the intricate openings
of the porous tongue. Therefore when the bodies of oozing fla-
vour are smooth, they pleasantly touch and pleasantly feel all
the parts about the moist exuding quarters of the palate. But
on the other hand when they rise in a mass they puncture and
tear the sense according to the degree in which they are pervaded
by roughness. Next the pleasure [rom the flavour reaches as far
as the palate3 when however it has passed down through the
throat, there is no pleasure while it is all distributing itself into
the frame. And it makes no matter what the food is with which
the body is nurtured, provided you can digest what you take and
transmit it into the frame and keep the stomach in an equable
condition of moistness.

I will now explain how it is that different food is pleasant and
nutritious for different creature& also why that which to some is
nauseous and bitter, may yet to others seem passing sweet3 and
why in these matters the difference and discrepancy is so great
that what to one man 15 food, to another 15 rank poison3 and
there is actually a serpent which on being touched by a man's
spittle wastes away and destroys 115611Ἃ by gnawing its body.
Again hellebore for us is rank poison, but helps to fatten goats
and quails. That you may know how this comes to pass, first of
all you must remember what we have said before, that the seeds
which are contained in things are mixed up in manifold ways.
Again all living 6163111165 soever which take food, even 35 they
are unlike on the outside‚ and, differing in each after its kind, an
exterior contour of limbs bounds them, so likewise are they formed
of seeds of varying shape. Again since the seeds differ, there
must be a discrepancy in the spaces between and the passages,
which we name openings, in all the limbs and mouth and palate
35 well. Some openings therefore must be smaHer, some larger;
some things must have them three-cornercd, others square; many
must be round, some many-angled after many fashions. For as
the relation between the shapes of seeds and their motions re-
quire, the openings also must differ accordingly in their shapes;
and the passages must vary, 35 varies the texture formed by the
