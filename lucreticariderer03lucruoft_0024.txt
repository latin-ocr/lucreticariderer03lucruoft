formed out of lire one and unmixed: it would avail nothing for
hot fire to be condensed or rarefied, if the same nature which the
whole fire has, belonged to the parts of fire as well. The hear,
would be more intense by compression of parts, more faint by
their severance and dispersion. More than this you cannot think
it 111 the power of such causes to effect, far less could so great a
diversity of things come from mere density and rarity of fircs.
Observe also, if they suppose void to be mixed up in things, fire
may then be condensed and left rare3 but because they see many
things rise up in contradiction to them and shrink from leaving
unmixed void in things, fearing the steep, they lose the true read,
and do not perceive on the other hand that if void is taken from
things, all things are condensed and out of all things is formed
one single body, which cannot briskly radiate anything from it, in
the way heat-giving fire emits light and warmth, letting you see
that it is not of closely compressed parts. But if they haply
think that in some other way fires may be quenched in the union
and change their body, you are to know that if they shall scruple
on no side to do this, all heat sure enough will be utterly brought
to nothing, and all things that are produced will be formed out
of nothing. For whenever a thing changes and quits its proper
limits, at once this change of state is the death of that which was
before. Therefore something or other must needs be left to those
fires of theirs undestroyed, that you may not have all things abso-
lutely returning to nothing, and the whole store of things born
anew and flourishing out of nothing. Since then in fact there are
some most unquestionable bodies which always preserve the same
nature, 011 whose going or coming and change of order things
change their nature and bodies are transformed, you are to know
that these first bodies of things are not of fire. For it would
matter nothing that some should withdraw and go away and
others should be added on and some should have their order
changed, if one and all they yet retained the nature of heat Í¾ for
whatever they produced would be altogether fire. But thus me-
thinks it is: there are certain bodies whose clashings motions order
position and shapes produce fires, and which by a change of order
change the nature of the things and do not resemble fire nor any-
thing else which has the power of sending bodies to our senses
and touching by its contact our sense of touch,
