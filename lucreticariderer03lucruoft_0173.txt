the force of the wind put in motion cannot burst the cloud which
it essays to burst, but weighs it down, so that it is like a pillar let
down from heaven into the 503, yet gradually, just as if a thing
were thrust down frossn above and stretched out to the level of the
waters by the fist and push of the arm3 and when the force of the
wind has rent this cloud, it bursts out from it into the sea and
occasionsa marvellous boiling in the waters3 for the whirling eddy
descends and brings down together with it yon cloud of limber
body3 and as soon as it has forced it down full-charged as it is to
the levels of the sea, the eddy in a moment plunges itself entire
into the water, and stirs up the whole sea with a prodigious noise
and forces it to boil. Sometimes too the eddy of wind wraps itself
up in clouds and gathers 01113 of the air seeds of cloud and imit-ates
in a sort the prester let down from heaven. When this prester
has let itself down to the land and has burst, it belches forth a
whirlwind and storm of enormous violence3 but as it seldom takes
place at all and as mountains cannot but obstruet it on land, it is
seen more frequently on the sea with its wide prospect and 1111011-
structed horizon.

Clouds are formed, when in this upper space of heaven many
bodies flying about have in some one instant met together, of a
rougher sort, such as are able, though they have got the very
slightest holds of each other, 130 catch together and be held in
union. These bodies first cause small clouds to form 3 and these
next catch together and collect into 11135505 and increase by join-
ing with each other and are carried on by the winds continually
until a fierce storm has gathered. The nearer too the tops of a
mountain in each 0350 are to heaven, the more constantly at this
elevation they smoke with the thick darkness of a swarthy cloud,
because, 35 50011 35 clouds form, before the eyes can see them, thin
as they are, the winds carry and bring them together to the
highest summits of 3 11101111133111Í¾ and then at last when they have
gathered in a greater 111355, being now dense they are able to
make themselves visible and at the same time they are seen to
rise up from the very top of the mountain into the ether: the very
fact of the case and our sensations, when we climb high 11101111-
tains, prove that the regions which stretch up on high are windy.
Again clothes hung up on the shore, when they drink in the
clinging moisture, prove that nature takes up many bodies over
