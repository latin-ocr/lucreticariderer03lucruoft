body is sunk in profound repose, yet then we seem to ourselves to
be awake and to be moving our limbs, and mid the thick dark-
ness of night we think we see the sun and the daylight; and
though in a confined 100111, we seem to be passing to new climates
5665 rivers and mountains and to be crossing plains on foot and to
hear noises, though the austere silence of night prevails all round,
and to be uttering speech though quite silent. Many are the
other marvels of this sort we see, which all seek to shake as it
were the credit of the senses: quite in vain, since the greatest
part of these cases cheats us on account of the mental suppositions
which we add of ourselves, taking those things as seen which have
not been 56611 by the senses. For nothing is harder than to sepa-
rate manifest facts from doubtful which straightway the mind
adds on of itself.

Again if 6 111611 believe that nothing is known, he knows
not whether this even can be known, since he admits he knows
nothing. I will therefore decline to argue the 6656 against him
who places himself with head where his feet should be. And
yet granting that he knows this, I would still put this question,
since he has never yet seen any truth in things, whence he knows
what knowing and not knowing severally are, and what it is
that has produced the knowledge of the true and the false and
what has proved the doubtful to differ from the certain. You
will find that from the senses first has proceeded the knowledge
of the true and that the senses cannot be refuted. For that
which is of itself to be able to refute things false by true things
must from the nature of the case be proved to have the higher
certainty. Well then what must fairly be accounted of higher
certainty than sense? Shall reason founded on false sense be
able to contradict them, wholly founded as it is on the senses?
and if they are not true, then all reason 65 well is rendered false.
Or shall the ears be able to take the eyes to task, or the touch the
ears? Again shall the taste call in question this touch, or the
nostrils resute or the eyes controvert it? Not 50, Ι 811655, for
each apart has its own distinct office, each its own power3 and
therefore we must perceive what is soft and cold or 1101 by 0116
distinct faculty, by another perceive the different colours of things
and thus see all objects which are conjoined with colour. Taste
