other parts, if haply you shall wish still again to vary the shapes.
From all this it results that increase of bulk in the body follows
upon newness of the shapes. Wherefore you cannot possibly
believe that seeds have an infinite variety of forms, 1051 you force
some to be of a monstrous hugones& which as Ι have above shown
cannot be proved. Moreover Ι 1611 you barbaric robes and radiant
Meliboean purple dipped in Thessalian dye of 5116115 [and the 111165
which are displayed] by the goldcn brood of peacocks steepcd in
laughing beauty would all be thrown aside surpassed by some new
6010111 01 things3 the smell of myrrh would be despised and the
fiavours of honey, and the melodies of the swan and Phoebcan
tunes set off by the varied play of strings would in like sort be
suppressed and silenced3 101 something ever would arise more
surpassing than the rest. All things likewise might fall back into
worse states, even as we have said they might advance to better;
for reversely too one thing would be more noisome than all other
things to 11051111 ear and eye and taste. Now since these things
are not 50, but a fixed limit has been assigned to things which
bounds their sum on each side, you must admit that matter also
has a finite number of different shapes. Once 111016 110111 summer
fires to chill frosts a definite path is traced out and in like manner
is again travelled back3 101 every degree of cold and heat and
intel-mediate warmths lie between those extremes, filling up in
succession the sum. Therefore the things produced differ by finite
degreeS, since at both ends they are marked off by points, one at
one, another at the other end, molested 011 1116 0116 hand by
flames, on the other by stiffening frosts.

And now that I have shewn this, I will go on to link to it a
truth which depends on this and from this draws its proof: the
first-beginnings of things which have a like shape 0116 with the
other, are infinite in number. F or since the difference of forms is
finite, those which are like must be infinite or the sum of matter
will be finite, which Ι proved not to be the case, when I shewed in
my verses that the minute bodies of matter from everlasting
continually uphold the sum of things through an uninterrupted
511666551011 01 blows on all sides. For though you see that some
animals are rarer than others and discern a less fruitful nature in
them, yet in another quarter and spot and in distant lands there
may be many of that kind and the full tale may be made 11p; just
