these things were accidents, timo now gone by has irrevocably
swept away. For whatever shall havc been done may be termed
an accident in one case of the Teucran pcoplc‚ in another of the
countrios simply. ch for if there had been no matter of things
and no room and space in which things scvci'ally go on, never had
the fire, kindled by love of the beauty of Tyndarus' daughter,
blazed beneath the Phrygian breast of Alexander and lighted up
the famous struggles of cruel war, nor had the timber horse un-
known to the Trqjans wrapt Pergama in flames by its night-
issuing brood of sons of the Greeks3 so that you may clearly
perceive that all actions from first to last exist not by themselves
and are not by themselves in the way that body is, nor are terms
of the same kind as void is, but are rather of such a kind that
you may fairly call them accidents of body and of the room in
which they severally go on.

Bodies again are partly first-beginnings of things, partly those
which are formed of a union of first-beginnings. But those which
are first-beginnings of things no force can quench: they are sure
to have the better by their solid body. Although it seems dif-
ficult to believe that aught can be found among things with a
solid body. For the lightning of heaven passes through the walls
of houses, as well as noise and voices3 iron grows red-hot in the
fire and stones burn with fierce heat and burst asunder3 the hard-
ness of gold 15 broken up and dissolved by heat ; the 100 of brass
melts vanquished by the fiame3 warmth and piercing cold ooze
through silver, since we have felt both, as we held cups with the
hand in due fashion and the water was poured down into them.
So universally there 15 found to be nothing solid in things. But
yet because true reason and the nature of things constmins,
attend until we make clear in a few verses that there are such
things as consist of solid and everlasting body, which we teach are
seeds of things and first-beginnings, out of which the whole sum
of things which now exists has been produced.

F irst of all then since there has been found to exist a two-sold
and widely dissimilar nature of two things, that is to say of body
and of place in which things severally go on, each of the two must
exist for. and by itself and quite unmixed. For wherever there
is empty space which we call void, there body is not3 wherever
again body maintains itself, there empty void no wise exists.
