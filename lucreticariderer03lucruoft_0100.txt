the sun even blinds them, if you pcrsist in turning them towards
it, because its power is great and idols are borne through the clear
air with great downward force from on high, and strike the eyes
and disorder their fastenings. Moreover any vivid brightness often
burns the eyes, because it contains many seeds of fire which make
a way in and beget pain in the eyes. Again whatever the jaun-
diced look at, becomes a greenish-yellow‚ because many seeds of
greenish-yellow stream from their body and meet the idols of
things, and many too are mixed up in their eyes, and these by
their infection tinge all things with sallow hues. Again we see
out of the dark things which are in the light for this reason: when
the black air of darkness being the nearer has first entered and
taken possession of the open eyeS, the bright white air follows
straightway after and cleanses them so to say and dispels the
black shadows of the other air3 for this is a great deal more nim-
1116, a great deal more subtle and more efficacious. As soon as
it has filled with light and opened up the passages of the eyes
which the black air had before blocked up, forthwith the idols
of things which are situated in the light follow and excite them
so that we see. This we cannot do conversely in the dark out of
the light, because the grosser air of darkness follows behind and
quite fills all the openings and blocks up the passages of the eyes,
not letting the idols of any things at all be thrown into the eyes
to move them. Again when we descry far off the square towers
of a town, they often appear to be round for this reason: all the
angles are seen from a distance to look obtuse, or rather are not
seen at all, and their blow is lost and their stroke never makes its
way to our sight, because while the idols are borne on through
much air, the air by repeated collisions blunts the stroke perforce.
then in this way all the angles have together eluded the sense,
the stone structures are rounded off as if by the lathe3 yet they
do not look like the things which are close before us and really
round, but somewhat resembling them as in shadowy outline.
Our shadow likewise seems to move in the sunshine and to fol-
low 0111· steps and mimic our action3 if you think forsooth that
air deprived of life can step, imitating the motions and the actions
of men3 for that which we are wont to term shadow can be no-
thing but air devoid of light. Sure enough because the earth in
certain spots successively is deprived of light wherever we inter-
