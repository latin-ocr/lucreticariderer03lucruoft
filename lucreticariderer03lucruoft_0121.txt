the covering males. See you not too how those whom mutual
pleasure has chained are often tortured in their common chains?
How often in the highways do dogs, desiring to separate, eagerly
pull different ways with all their might, while all the time they
are held fast in the strong fetters of Venus! This they would
never do, unless they experienced mutual joys, strong enough to
force them into the snare and hold them in its meshes. 11711919-
fore again and again I repeat there is a common pleasure.

And when haply in mixing her seed with 1119 man's the
woman by sudden force has overpowered and seized for herself

his force, 111911 children are formed from 1119 mothers' seed like
10 1119 1110111919, 39 from the fathers' seed like 1ο 1119 fathers.
But those whom you 999 with a share of both forms, blending
equally the features of the parents, grow from the union of the
father’s body and the mother's blood, when the mutual ardour
of desire working in concert has brought and clashed together the
seeds roused throughout the frame by the goads of Venus3 and

Sometimes too the children may spring up like their grandfathers
and often resemble the forms of their grandfathers’ fathers, be-
cause the parents often keep concealed in their bodies many first-
beginnings mixed in many ways² which first proceeding from the
original stock one father hands down to the next father3 and then
from these Venus produces forms after 3 manifold chance and
repeats not only the features, but the voices and hair of their
forefathers. And the female sex equally springs from the father's
seed and males go forth equally formed from the mother’s body;
since these distinctions no more proceed from the fixed seed of
one or other parent than our faces and bodies and limbs: the
birth is always formed out of the two seeds; and whichever
parent that which is produced more resembles‚ of that parent
it has more than 311 equal share3 as you may equally observe,
whether it is a male child or a female birth.

Nor do the divine powers debar anybody from the power of
begetting, forbidding him ever to receive the name of father
from sweet children and forcing him to pass his life in a barren
wedlock3 39 111911 commonly fancy when in sorrow they drench
the altars with much blood and pile the raised altars with offer-
