gives increase and food out of itsclf to other things, must be les-
sened3 and must be rcfflcnished, when it takes things back.

Again if thore was no birth-time of carth and heaven and
they have bccn from everlasting, why before the Theban war and
the destruction of Troy have not other pocts as well sung other
themes? whither have so many (leeds of men so often passed
away, why live they nowhere enibodicd in lasting records of same?
The truth incthinks is that the sum has but a recent date and
the nature of the world is new and has but latcly had its com-
inencexnent. Wherefore even now some arts are receiving their
last polish, some are even in course of growth: just now many
iinprovenients have been made in ships3 only yesterday musicians
have given* birth to tuneful melodies3 then too this nature or
system of things has been discovered lately, and I the very first
of all have only now been found able to transfer it into native
words. But if haply you believe that before this all things have
existed just the same, but that the generations of men have
perished by burning hcat, or that cities have fallen by some great
concussion of the world, or that after constant rains devouring
rivers have gone forth over the earth and have whelmed towns,
so much the inore you must yield and admit that there will be
entire destruction too of earth and heaven, for when things were
tried by so great disteinpers and so great dangers, at that time
had a more disastrous cause pressed upon them, they would far
and wide have gone to destruction and lnighty ruin. And in no
other way are we ‘proved to be mortalS, except because we all alike
in turn fall sick of the same diseases which those had whom nature
has withdrawn from life.

Again whatever things last for ever, must either, because
they are of solid body, repel strokes and not suffer aught to pass
into them, sufficient to disunite the closely massed parts within:
such are the bodies of matter whose nature we have shewn be-
fore: or they must be able to endure through all time for this
reason, because they are exempt from blows, as void is which
remains untouched and suffers not 3 jot from any stroke; or else
because there is no extent of room around, into which things so
to say may depart and be broken up: in this way the sum of sums
is eternal and there is no place outside into which things may
spring asunder, nor are there any bodies whicli can fall upon
