pierce and bore. And they would set about these works just
as much with silver and gold at first as with the overpowering
strength of stout oopper, but in vain, since their force would
fail and give way and not be able like oopper to stand the severe
» 31313111. At that time copper was in higher esteem and gold would
lie neglected on account of its 1136163311633, with its dull blunted
edge: now copper lies neglected‚ gold has mounted up to the
highest place of honour. Thus time as it goes round changes the
36330113 of things. That which was in esteem, falls at length into
utter disrepute; and then another thing mounts up and 1331163 out
of its degraded state and every day is more and more coveted and
blossoms forth high in honour when discovered and 13 111 11131-
vellous repute with nien.

And now, Memmius, it is easy for you to find out by your-
self in what way the nature of iron was discovered. Arms of
old were hands 113113 and teeth and 31301163 and boughs broken
off from the forests, and fiame and fire, as soon 33 they had be-
come known. Afterwards the force of iron and oopper was dis-
oovered3 and the use of copper was known before that of iron,
as its nature is 633161 to work and it 13 found in greater quan-
tity. With eopper they would labour the 3011 of the earth, with
copper stir up the billows of war and deal about wide-gaping
wounds and seize cattle and lands; for every thing defenoeless
and unarmed would readily yield to them with arms in hand.
Then by slow steps the sword of iron gained ground and the
make of the oopper sickle became a byword3 and with iron they
began to plough through the earth's soil, and the struggles of
wavering war were rendered equal. And the oustom of mounting
in arms on the back of a horse and guiding him with reins and
shewing prowess with the right hand 13 older than that of tempt-
ing the risks of war in a two-horsed ohariot3 and yoking a pair
of 110136313 older than yoking four or mounting 111 arms seythed
ohariots. Next the Poeni taught the lucan kine with towered
body, hideous of aspect, with snake-like hand, to endure the
wounds of war and to disorder the mighty ranks of Mars. Thus
sad disoord begat one thing after another, to affright nations of
men under arms, and every day made some addition to the terrors

Ι of war.

They made trial of bulls too in the service of war and es-
