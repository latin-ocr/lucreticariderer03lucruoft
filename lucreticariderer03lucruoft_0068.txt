that time is moved in many ways and admits into it all the mo-
110115 of joy and unreal cares of the heart. Now that you may
know that the 50111 65 well is in the limbs and that the body is
not wont to have sense by any harmony, 11115 15 6 main proof:
when much of the body has been taken away, still life often stays
in the limbs3 and yet the same life, when a few bodies of heat
have been dispcrsed abroad and some air 1165 been forced out
through the mouth, abandons at once the 1761115 and quits the
bones: by this you may perc-eive that all bodies have not func-
110115 of like importance nor alike uphold existence, but rather
that those seeds which constitute wind and heat, 6111156 life to
stay in the limbs. Therefore vital heat and wind are within the
body and abandon our frame at death. Since then the nature
of the mind and that of 1116 50111 116176 been proved to be a part
as it were of the man, surrender the name of harmony, whether
brought down to musicians from high Helicon, 01· whether rather
they have themselves taken it from something else and transferred
it to that thing which then was in need os a distinctive name;
whatever it 116, let them keep it: do you take in the rest of my
precepts.

Now I assert that the mind and the 50111 are kept together
in 61056 11111011 and make up a single nature, but that the direct-
ing principle which we call mind and understanding, 15 1116 head
50 to speak and reigns paramount in the whole body. It has a
fixed seat in the middle region of the breast ε here throb fear and
apprehension, about these spots dwell soothing joys; therefore
here 15 1116 understanding or mind. All the rest of the 50111 dis-
seminated through the whole body obeys and moves at the will
and inclination of the mind. It by itself alone knows for itself,
rejoices for itself, at times when the impression does not move
either 50111 01 body together with it. And as when some part
of us, the head 01· the eye, suffers from an attack of pain, we do
not feel the anguish at the same time over the whole body, thus
the mind sometimes suffers pain by itself or 15 inspirited with joy,
when all the rest of the 50111 throughout the limbs and frameis
stirred by no novel sensation. But when the mind 15 excited by
some more vehement apprehension, we 566 the whole 50111 feel
in unison through all the limbs, sweats and paleness spread over
the whole body, the tongue salter, the voice die away, 6 mist
