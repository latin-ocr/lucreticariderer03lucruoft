11161 611 food, solid as well as liquid, must be held to be composed
of things foreign to them in kind, of bones that is and sinews and
matter and blood mixed up. Again if all the bodies which grow
out of the earth, are in the earths, the earth must be composed of
things foreign to it in kind which grow out of these earths. Apply
again this reasoning to other things and you may use just thc
same words. If flame and smoke and ash are latent in woods,
woods must necessarily be composed 01 things foreign to them in
kind. Again all those bodies, to which the earth gives food, it
increases [out of things foreign to them in kind which rise out of
the earth: thus too the bodies of fiame which issue from the woods,
are fed] out of things foreign to 1116111 111 kind which rise out of
these woods.

Here some slight opening is 1611 101 evasion, which Anaxagoras
avails himself 01, choosing to suppose that all things though latent
are mixed up in things, and that is alone visible of which there
616 1116 largest number of bodies in the mixture and these more
ready to hand and stationed in the first rank. This however is 161
banished from true reason. For then it were natural that corn too
should often, when crushed by 1116 formidable force of 1116 stone,
shew some mark of blood or some other of 1116 things which have
their nourishment in our body. For like reasons it were fitting
that from grasses too, when we rub them between two 6101166, blood
should ooze out3 that waters should yield sweet drops, in flavour
like to the udder of milk in sheep3 yes and that often, when clods
of earth have been crumbled, kinds of grasses and corn and leaves
should be found to lurk distributed among the earth in minute
quantities3 and lastly that ash and smoke and minute fires should.
be found latent in woodS, when they were broken off. Now since
plain matter of fact 16661166 11161 110116 01 111666 16611116 follows, you
616 10 know that things are not so mixed up in things; but rather
seeds common to many things must in many ways be mixed up
and 1616111 111 things.

‘But it often comes to pass on high mountains’ you say ‘that
contiguous tops of tall trees rub together, the strong southwinds
constraining them so to do, until the flower of fiame has broken
out and they have burst into a blaze '. Quite true and yet fire is
not innate in woods; but there are many seeds of beat, and when
they by rubbing have streamed together, they produce conflagra-
