require seed before they 0311 severally be born and be brought out
into the buxom fields of air. Lastly since we see that tilled
grounds surpass untilled and yield a better produce by the labour
of hands, we may infer that there arc in the earth first-beginnings
of things which by turning up the fruitful clods with the share
and labouring the soil of the earth wc stimulate to rise. But if
there were not such, you would see all things without any labour
of ours spontaneously come forth 111 much greater perfectiori.
Morcover nature dissolves every thing back into its first bodies
and does not annihilate things. For if aught were mortal in all
its parts alike‚ the thing in a moment would be snatched away to
destruction from before our eyes, since no force would be needed
to produce disruption among its parts and undo their fastenings.
Whereas in fact, as all things 00115151 of an imperishable seed, na-
ture suffers the destruction of nothing to be seen, until 3 force has
encountered it sufficient to dash things to pieces by 3 blow or to
pierce through the void places within them and break them up.
Again if time, whenever it makes away with things through age,
utterly destroys them eating up all their matter, out of what does
Venus bring back into the light of life the race of living things
each after its kind, or, when they are brought back, out of what
does earth manifold in works give them nourishment and increase,
furnishing them with sood each after its kind? Out of what do
its own native fountains and extraneous rivers from far and wide
keep full the sea? Out of what does ether seed the stars? For
infinite time gone by and lapse of days must have eaten up all
things which 310 of mortal body. Now if in that period of time
gone by those things have existed, of which this sum of things
is composed and recruited, they are possessed 110 doubt of an
imperishable body, and cannot therefore any of them return
to nothing. Again the same force and cause would destroy all
things without distinction, unless everlasting matter held them
together, matter more or less closely linked in mutual entangle-
ment: a touch in sooth would be sufficient cause of death, inas-
much as any amount of force must of course undo the texture
of things in which no parts at all were of an everlasting body.
But in fact, because the fastenings of first-beginnings one with
the other are unlike and matter is everlasting‚ things continue
with body uninjured, until a force is found to encounter them
