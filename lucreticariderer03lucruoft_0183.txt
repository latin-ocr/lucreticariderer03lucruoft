buoy themselves up and lean upon their 11711135, 11611116, you know,
compels them by their weight to tumble down to earth, and lying
stark through what is now almost a void they disperse their soul
through all 1116 0116011135 of 111611· body. * * Again during summer the
water in wells 1166011165 colder, because the earth is rarefied by heat
and rapidly sends out into the aii· whatever seeds of heat it hap-
pens to have. The more then the earth is drained of 11661, 1116
colder becomes the water which is hidden in the earth. Again
when all the earth is compressed by cold and 6011116615 and so to
say 601136615, 111611, you are to know, while it 6011116615, 11 presses
out into the wells whatever heat it contains itself.

At the fano of Hammon there 15 said to be a fountain which
is cold in the daylight and ⁴hot in the night—time. This fountain
men marvel at exceedingly and suppose that it suddenly becomes
hot by the 111111161166 of the fierce sun below the earth, when night
has covered 1116 earth with awful darkness. But this 15 far far
removed from truc reason. Why when the sun though in contact
with the uncovered body of the water has not been able to make 113
1101 on its upper side, though his light above possesses such great
heat, how can he below the earth which 15 of so dense a body boil
the water and glut it with heat? above all when he can scarcely
with 1115 11111111113 rays force 1115 116613 through the walls of 11011565.
What then is 1116 cause? this sure enough: the earth 15 more
porous and 1176111161· round the fountain than 1116 1651 of the earth,
and there are many seeds of 1116 near the body of water. For this
reason when night has buried 1116 earth in 115 dewy shadows, the
earth at once becomes quite cold and contracts: in this way just as
if it were squeezed by the hand it forces out into the fountain
whatever seeds of 1116 11 has; and 111656 make the water hot 10 the
touch and taste. Next when the sun has risen and with 1115 rays
has loosened 1116 661111 and has rarefied it as his heat waxes
stronger, the first-beginnings of 1116 return back to their ancient
seats and all the heat of the water withdraws into the earth: for
this reason the fountain becomes cold in the daylight. Again the
liquid of water 15 played upon by the sun's rays and in 1116 day-
111116 15 rarefied by his throbbing heat3 and therefore it gives up
whatever seeds of 1116 11 1165; just as it often parts with the
frost which it holds in itself, and thaws the 166 and loosens its

bonds.
