which arc of solid singleness, when they pass through empty void
and nothing delays them from without and they themselves, single
from the nature of their parts, are borne with headlong endeavour
towards the one single spot to which their efforts tend, must sure
enough surpass in velocity and be carried along much more swiftly
than the light of the sun, and race through many times the extent
of space in the same time in which the 11001110 of the sun fill the
heaven throughout. * nor follow up the several first-beginnings to
sec by what law each thing goes on.

But some-in opposition to this, ignorant of matter, believe that
nature cannot without the providcnce of the gods in such nice
conformity to 1110 ways of men vary the seasons of the year and
bring forth omps, ay and all the other things, which divine
pleasure 1110 8111110 of life prompts 01011 10 approach, escorting them
in person and enticing them by her fondlings 10 continue their
races through the arts of Venus, that mankind may not come to an
end. Now when they suppose that the gods (1001811οᾶ all things
for the sake of men, they seem to 1110 111 011 respects to have
strayed most widely from true reason. For even if I did not know
what first-beginnings are, yet this, judging by the very arrange-
ments of heaven, I would venture to affirm, and led by many other
circumstances to maintain, that the nature of the world has by no
means been made for us by divine power: so great are the defects
twith which it stands encumbered. All which, Memmius, we will
hei-eal'ter make clear 10 you: we will now 80 on to explain what
remains to be told of motions.

Now methinks is the place, herein to prove this point also that
no bodily thing can by its own power be borne upwards and travel
upwards; that the bodies of flames may not in this manner lead
you into error. For they are begotten with an upward tendency,
and in the same direction receive increase, and goodly crops and
trees grow upwards, though their weights, so far as in them is, all
tend downwards. And when fires leap to the roofs of houses and
with swift flame lick up rafters and beams, we are not to suppose
that they do so spontaneously without a force pushing them up.
Even thus blood discharged from our body spirts out and springs
up on high and scatters gore about. See you not too with what
force the -liquid of water spits out logs and beams? the more
deeply we have pushed them sheer down and have pressed them
