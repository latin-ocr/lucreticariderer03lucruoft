in, many of us together, with all our might and much painful
effort‚ with the greater avidity it vomits them up and casts them
forth, so that they rise and start out more than half their length.
And yet methinks we doubt not that these, so far as in themis,
are all borne downwards through the empty void. In the same
way flames also ought to be able, when squeezed out, to mount
upward through the air, although their weights, so far as in them
is, strive to (lraw them down. See you not too that the nightly
meteors of heaven as they fly alost draw after them long trails of
flames in whatever direction nature has given them a passage?
Do you not perceive stars and constellations fall to the earth?
The sun also from the height of heaven sheds its heat on all
sides and sows the fields with light3 to the earth therefore as
well the sun's heat tends. Lightnings also you see fly athwart
the rains: now from this side now from that fires burst from
the clouds and 111811 about; the force of 1131110 falls to the earth
all round.

This point too herein we wish you to apprehend: when bodies
are borne downwards sheer through void by their own weights, at
quite uncertain times and uncertain spots they push themselves a
little from their course: you just and only just can call it a change
of inclination. If they were not used to swerve, they would all
fall down, like drops of rain, through the deep void, and no clashing
would have been begotten nor blow produced among the first—
beginnings: thus nature never would have produced aught.

But if haply any one believes that heavier bodies, 38 they are
carried more quickly sheer through space, can fall from above on
the lighter and so beget blows able to produce begetting motions,
he goes most widely astray from true reason. For whenever bodies
fall through water and thin air, they must quicken their descents
in proportion to their weights, because the body of water and
subtle nature of air cannot retard everything in equal degree, but
more readily give way, overpowered by the heavier: on the other
hand empty void cannot offer resistance to anything in any direc-
tion at any time, but must, as its nature Graves, continually give
way3 and for this reason all things must be moved and borne
along with equal velocity though of unequal weights through the
uni-esisting void. Therefore heavier things will never be able to
fall from above 011 lighter nor of themselves to beget blows
