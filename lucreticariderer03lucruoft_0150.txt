sear or pain and when joys are rife. This you may learn from
facts plain to sense: when the large spongy open lips of Molos-
sian dogs begin to growl enraged and bare their hard teeth, thus
drawn back in rage they threaten in a tone far different from
that in which they bark outright and fill with sounds all the
places round. Again when they essay fondly to lick their whelps
with their tongue or when they toss them with their feet and
snapping at them make a seint with lightly closing teeth of
swallowing though with gentle forbearance, they caress thern
with a yelping sound of a sort greatly differing from that which
they utter when left alone in a house they bay or when they
slink away howling from blows with a crouching body. Again is
not the neigh too seen to differ, when a young sta-Ilion in the
flower of age rages among the mares smitten by the goads of
winged love, and when with wide-stretched nostrils he snorts out
the signal to arms, and when as it chances on any other occasion
he neighs with limbs all shaking? Lastly the racc of fowls and
various birds, hawks and osprays and gulls seeking their living
in the salt water mid the waves of the sea, utter at a different
time noises widely different from those they make when they are
fighting for food and struggling with their prey. And some of
them change together with the weather their harsh croakings,
as the long-lived races of crows and fiocks of rooks when they
are said to be calling for water and rain and sometimes to be
summoning winds and gales. Therefore if different sensations
compel creatures, dumb though they be, to utter different sounds,
how much more Ql it is that mortal men in those times should
have been able to denote dissimilar things by many different
words!

And lest haply on this head you ask in silent thought this
question, it was lightning that brought fire down on earth for
mortals in the beginning3 thence the whole heat of flames is
spread abroad. Thus we see many things shine dyed in heavenly
flames, when the stroke from heaven has stored them with its
heat. Ay and without this when a branching tree sways to and
fro and tosses about under the buffeting of the winds, pressing
against the boughs of another tree, fire is forced out by the power
of the violent friction, and sometimes the burning heat of flame
flashes out, the boughs and stems rubbing against each other.
