There is also a cold lountain of such a nature that tow often
when held over it iinbibes fire forthwith and eniits= flame3 a pine
torch in like manner is lighted and shines among the waters, in
whatever direction it swirns under the impulse of the winds.
Because sure enough there are in the water very many seeds of
heat, and froin the earth itself at the bettoni must rise up bodies
of fire throughout the whole fountziin and at the same time pass
abre-ad in exhalations and go forth into the air, not in such numbers
however that the fountain can become hot, for these reasons a
force compels those seeds to burst out through the water and dis-
perse abi-ead and to unite when they have mounted up. In
the sea at Aradus is a fountain of this kind, which wells up with
fresh water and keeps off the salt waters all round it3 and in
many oth’er quarters the sea affords a seasonable help in need to
thirsting sailms, vomiting forth fresh waters amid the salt. In
this way then those seeds may burst forth through that fountain
and well out3 and when they are met together in the tow or
cohere in the body of the pine-toreh, they at once readily take
fire, because the tow and pinewood contain 111 them likewise
many seeds of latent fire. See you not too that, when you bring a
newly extinguished wick near night-lamps it catches light before
it has touched the flame3 and the same with the pinewood? And
many things beside catch fire at some distance touched merely by
the heat, before the fire in actual contact infects them. This
therefore you must suppose to take place in that fountain as
well.

Next in order Ι will proceed to discuss by what law of nature
it comes to pass that iron can be attracted by that stone which
the Greeks call the Magnet from the name of its native place,
because it has its origin within the bounds of the country of the
Magnesians This stone men wonder at; as it often produces a
chain of rings hanging down from it. Thus you may see some-
times five and more suspended 111 succession and tossing about in
the light airs, one always hanging down from 0110 and attached to
its lower side, and each in turn one from the other experiencing
the binding power of the stone: with such a continued current its
force flies through all.

In things of this kind many points must be established before
you can assign the true law of the thing in question, and it must
