ing, they spread themselves in groups on the soft grass beside
a stream of water under the boughs of a high tree and at no great
cost pleasantly refresh their bodies, above all when the weather
smiles and the seasons of the year besprinkle the green grass with
fiowers. Nor do hot severs sooner quit the body, if you toss about
on pictured tapestry and blushing purple, than if you must lie
under a poor man's blanket. VVherefore since treasures avail
nothing in respect of our body nor birth nor the glory of kingly
power, advancing farther you must hold that they are of no service
to the mind as well, unless may be when you see your legions
swarm over the ground of the campus waging the mimicry of war,
fx strengthened fiank ancl rear by powerful reserves and great force
of cavalry, and you marshall them equipped in arms and animated
’ with one spirit, thereupon you find that religious scruples scared
by these things fly panic-stricken from the mind, and that then
fears of death leave the breast unembarrassed and free from care,
when you see your fleet swarm forth and spread itself far and

can you doubt that this is wholly the prerogative of reason, when
the whole of life withal is a struggle in the dark? For even

to be dreaded than those which children shudder at in the dark
and fancy sure to bc. This terror therefore and darkness of mind
must be dispelled not by the rays of the sun and glittering shafts
of day, but by the aspect and law of nature.

Now mark and I will explain by what motion the begetting
bodies of matter do beget different things and after they are begot-
ten again break them up, and by what force they are compelled
so to do and what velocity is given to them for travelling through
the great void: do you mind to give heed to my words. For verily
matter does not cohere inseparably massed together, since we see
that everything wanes and perceive that all things ebb as it were
by length of time and that age withdraws them from our sight,
though yet the sum is seen to remain unimpaired by reason that
