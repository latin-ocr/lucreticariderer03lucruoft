trampling of men and the mount-ains stricken by the shouting
1000110 1110 voices to the stars of heaven, and horsemen fly about
and suddenly wheeling scour across the middle of the plains>
shaking them with the vehemence of their charge. And yet
there is some spot on the high 111115, 50011 from which they appear
to stand still and to rest on the plains as a bright spot.

Now mark and next in order approbem-l of what kind and
how widely differing in their forms are the beginnings of all
things, how varied by manifold diversities of shape3 not that a
scanty number are possessed of a like form, but because as a 11110
they do not all resemble one the other. And no wonder; for
since there is so great a store of them that, as I have shewn‚ there
is no end or sum, they must sure enough not one and all be
marked by an equal bulk and like shape, one with another. Let
the race of man pass before you in review, and the mute 51111111-

beasts and the different birds which haunt the gladdening
watering spots about river-banks and springs and pools, and
those which fiit about and throng the pathless woods: then go
and take any one you like in any one kind, and you will yet
find that they differ in their shapes, every one from every other.
And in no other way could child recognise mother or mother

just as well known to one another as human beings are. Thus
often in front of the beauteous shrines of the gods a calf falls
sacrificed beside the incense-burning altars, and spirts from its
breast a warin stream of blood3 but the bereaved mother as she
ranges over the green lawns knows the footprints stamped on the
ground by the cloven hoofs, scanning with her eyes every spot
to see if she can anywhere behold her lost youngling: then she
fills with her moanings the leafy wood each time she desists from
her search and again and again goes back to the stall pierced to
the heart by the loss of her calf 3 nor can the soft willows and
grass quickened with dew and yon rivers gliding level with their
banks comfort her mind and put away the care that has entered
into her, 1101 0011 011101 forms of calves throughout the glad pas-
tures divert her mind and ease it of its care: so persistently she
seeks something special and known. Again the tender kids with
