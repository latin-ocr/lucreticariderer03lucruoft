it out with carcs; and when ill deeds are in 1110 past, remorse for
sins yet gnaws: then there is madness peculial* to the mind and
forgetfulness of all things3 then too it often sinks into the black
waters of lethargy.

Death therefore to us is nothing, concerns us not a jot, since
the nature of the mind is proved to be mortal; and as in time
gone by we felt no distress, when the Poeni from all sides came
together to (lo battle, and all things shaken by war’s troublous
uproar shuddered and quaked beneath high heaven, and mortal
men were in doubt which of the two peoples it should be to
whose empire all must fall by sea and land alike, thus when we
shall be no more, when there shall have been a separation of
body and soul, 0111 01 both of which we are each formed into a
single being, to 113, you may be sure, who then shall be no
more, nothing whatever can happen to excite sensatim, not 11
earth shall be iningled with sea and sea with heaven. And
even supposing the nature of the mind and power of the soul do
feel, after they have been severed from our body, yet that is
nothing to us who by the binding tie of marriage between body
and soul are formed each into one single being. And if time
should gather up our matter after our death and put it once
more into the position in which it now is, and the light of life
be given to us again, this result even would concern us not
at all, when 1110 chain of our sels-consciousness has once been
snapped asunder. So now we give ourselves no concern about any
self which we have been before, nor do we feel any distress on

past course of immcasurable time and think how manifold are
the shapes which the motions 01 matter take, you may easily
credit this 100, 11101 111030 very same seeds of which we now are
formed, have often before been placed in the same order in
which they now are; and yet we cannot recover this in memory:
a break in our existence 1103 been interposed, and all the motions
have wandered to and fro far astray from the sensations they
produced. For he whom evil 13 10 100101, must in his own person
exist at the very time it 0011103, 11 1110 misery and suffering are
haply to have any place at all; but since death precludes this,
and 101111113- him to be, upon whom the ills can be brought, you
may be sure that we have nothing to sear after death, and
