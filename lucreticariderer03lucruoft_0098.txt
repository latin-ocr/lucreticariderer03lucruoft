we turn our sight, there all the several things meet and strike
it with their shape and colour. And the image gives the power
to 506 and the means to distinguish how far each thing is
distant from us; for as soon 65 ever it is ‹lischarged, it pushes
before it and impcls all the air which lies between it and the
eyes3 and thus that air 611 streams through our eyes and
brushes 50 to say the pupils and so passes through. The con-
sequence is that we 566 how far distant each thing is. And the
greater the quantity of 611 which is driven on before it and the
larger the current which brushes our eycS, the more distant
66011 different thing is seen to be. You must know these pro-
cesses go on with extreme lapidity, so that at one and the 561116
moment we see what like a thing is and how far distant it is.
And this must by no means be deemed strange herein that,
while the idols which strike the eyes cannot be seen one at
6 111116, 1116 things themselves are seen. For thus when the
wind too beats us with successive strokes and when piercing
cold streams‚ we are not wont to feel each single particle of that
wind and cold, but rather the whole result; and then we per-
ceive blows take effect on our body just 65 if something 01
other were beating it and giving us a 56115611011 of its body out-
side. Again when we thump a stone with a finger, we touch
merely the outermost colour on the surface of the stone, and
yet we do not feel that colour by our touch, but rather we feel
the very hardness of the stone seated in its inmost depths.
Now mark, and 166111 why the image is seen beyond the
mirror3 for without doubt it is seen withdrawn far within. The
0656 15 just the same as with things which 616 viewed in their
reality beyond 6 door, when it offers through it an unobstructed
prospect and lets many things outside be seen from 6 house.
That vision too is effected by two separate airs: first there is
611 611· 56611 111 511011 6 0656 inside the doorway3 next come the
leaves of the door right and left3 next a light outside brushes
the eyes, then 6 second air, then those things outside which are
viewed in their reality. Thus when the image of the mirror 1165
first discharged itself, in coming to our sight it pushes forward
and impels 611 1116 611 which lies between it and the eyes, and
enables us to see the whole of it before the mirror. But when we
have perceived the mirror as well, 61 01106 1116 image which is
