out by protractcd length of days, bury it in its ruins? Why an
immortal being incurs no risks.

Again for souls to stand by at the unions of Venus and the
birth-throes of beasts seems to be passing absin-d, for them the
immortals to wait for mortal limbs in number numberless and
struggle with 0110 another in forward rivalry, which shall first and
by preference have entrance in3 unless haply bargains are struck
among the souls on these terms, that whichever in its flight shall
first come up, shall first have right of entry, and that they shall
make no trial at all of each other’s strength.

Again a tree cannot exist in the ether, nor clouds in the deep
sea nor can fishes live in the fields nor blood exist in woods nor
sap in stones. Where each thing can grow and abido is fixed and
ordained. Thus the nature of the mind cannot come into being
alone without the body nor exist far away from the sinews and
blood. But if (for this would be much more likely to happen than
that) the force itself of the mind might be in the head or shoul-
ders or heels or might be born in any other part of the body, it
would after all be wont to abide in one and the same man or
vessel. But since in our body even it is lixed and seen to be
ordained where the soul and the mind can severally be and grow,
it must still more strenuously be denied that it can abide and be
born out of the (body altogether. Therefore when the body has
died, we must admit that the 50111 has perished, wrenched away
throughout the body. To link forsooth a moi-tal thing with an
everlasting and suppose that they can have sense 111 common and
can be reciprocally acted upon, is sheer folly3 for what 0311 be
conceived 111016 incongruous, 111016 discordant and inconsistent
with itself, than a thing which is mortal, linked with an immortal
and everlasting thing7 trying in such union to weather furious
storms? But if haply the soul is to be accounted immortal for
this reason rather, because it is kept sheltered from death-bring·
ing things, either because things hostile to its existence do not
approach at all, or because those which do approach, in 501116
way 01 other retreat discomfited before we can feel the harm
they do, [manifest experience proves that this can not be true}
For besides that it sickens in syinpathy with the maladies of the
body, it¹ is often attacked by that which frets it on the score
of the future and keeps it 011 the rack of suspense and wears
