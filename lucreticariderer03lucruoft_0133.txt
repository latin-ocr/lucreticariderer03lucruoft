them and dissolve them by a powerful blow. But the nature of
the world, as I have shewn, is neither of solid body, since void
is mixed up in things, nor is it again like void, no nor is there
lack of bodies that may haply rise up in mass out of the infinite
and overthrow this sum of things with furious tornado or bring
'upon them some other perilous disaster 3 nor further is the nature
of room or the space of deep void wanting, into which the walls
of the world may be scattered abroad3 01 they may be assailed
and perish by some other force. Therefore the gate of death is
not closed against heaven or sun or earth or the deep waters of
the sea, but stands open and looks towards them with huge

do they breathe out with undecided issue, and strive with each
other to determine it for mighty ends3 though once by the way
fire got the upper hand and once, as the story goes, water reigned
paramount in the fields. F ire gained the mastery and licked and
burnt up many things, when the headstrong might of the horses of
the sun dashed from the course and hurried Phaethon through the
whole sky and over all lands. But the almighty father, stirred
then to fierce wrath, with a sudden thunderstroke dashed Phae-
thon down from his horses to earth, and the sun meeting him as
he fell caught from him the ever-burning lamp of the world and
got in hand the scattered steeds and yoked them shaking all over,
then guided them on their proper course and gave fresh life to all
