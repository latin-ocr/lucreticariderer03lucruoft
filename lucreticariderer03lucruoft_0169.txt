ings and lightnings go on all about. For I have shewn above that
hollow clouds have very many seeds of heat, and they must also
take many in from the sun's rays and their heat. On this account
when the same wind which happens to collect them into any one
place, has forced 0111 many seeds of heat and has mixed 115611Ί up
with that fire‚ then the eddy of wind forces a way in and whirls
about in the straitened room and points the thunderbolt in the
fiery furnaces within 3 for it is kindled in two ways at once: it is
heated by its own velocity and from the cont-act of fire. After that
when the force of the wind has been thoroughly heated and the
impetuous power of the fire has entered in, then the thunderbolt
fully forged as it were suddenly rends the cloud, and the heat put
in motion is carried on traversing all places with fiashing lights.
Close upon it falls so heavy a clap that it seems to crush down
from above the quarters of heaven which have all at once sprung
asunder. Then a trembling violently seizes the earth and rumb-
lings run through high heaven; for the whole body of the storm
then without exception quakes with the shock and loud roarings
are aroused. After this shock follows so heavy and copious a rain
that the whole ether seems to be turning into rain and then to be
tumbling down and returning to a deluge: so great a fiood of it 15
discharged by the bursting of the cloud and the storm of wind,
when the sound flies forth from the burning stroke. At times too
the force of the wind 561 111 motion from without falls on a cloud
hot with a fully forged thunderbolt3 and when it has burst it,
forthwith there falls down yon fiery eddying whirl which in our
native speech we call a thunderbolt. The same takes place on
every other side towards which the force in question has borne
down. Sometimes too the power of the wind though discharged
without fire, yet catches fire in the course of its long travel, and
while it is passing on, it loses 011 1116 way some large bodies which
cannot like the rest get through the air3 and gathers together out
of the air 115611ἢ and carries along with it other bodies of very
small size which mix with it and produce fire by their flight; very
much in the same way as a leaden ball becomes hot during its
course, when it loses many bodies of cold and has taken up fire in
the air. Sometimes too the force of the blow itself strikes out fire,
when the force of wind discharged in a cold state without fire has
struck, because sure enough, when it has smitten with a powerful
