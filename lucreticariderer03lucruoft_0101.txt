cept it in moving about, while that part of it which we have quit-
ted is filled with light, therefore that which was the shadow of
our body, seems to have always followed us unchanged in a direct
line with us. For new rays of light ever pour in and the cld are
lost, just as if wool were drawn into the fire. Therefore the earth
is readily stripped of light, and again filled, and cleanses itself from
black shadows.

And yet in all this we do not admit that the eyes are cheated
0116 whit. For it is their province to observe in what spot soever
light and shade are3 but whether the lights are still the same or
not, and whether it is the same shadow which was in this spot
that is now passing to that, or whether what we said a little
before is not rather the fact, this the reason of the mind, and
only it, has to determine; nor can the eyes know the nature of
things. Do not then fasten upon the eyes this frailty of the
mind. The ship in which we are 56111118, moves on while seeming
to stand still3 that one which remains at its moorings, is believed
to be passing by. The hills and fields seem to be dropping astern,
past which we are driving our ship and flying under sail. The
stars all seem to be at rest fast fixed to the ethereal vaults, and yet
are 611 111 constant motion, since they rise and then go back to their
far-off places of setting, after they have traversed the length of
heaven with their bright bodies. In like manner sun and 1110011
seem to stay in 0116 place, bodies which simple fact proves are
carried on. And though between mountains rising up afar off
from amid the waters there opens out for fleets a free passage of
wide extent, yet a single island seems to be formed out of them
united into one. When children have stopped turning round
themselves, the halls appear to them to whirl about and the
pillars to course round to such a degree, that they can scarce
believe that the whole roof is not threatening to tumble down
upon them. Again when nature begins to raise on high the
sun’s beam ruddy with bickering fires and to lift it up above the
mountains‚ those hills above which the sun then seems to you
to be, as blazing close at hand he dyes them with his own fire,
are distant from us scarce two thousand a1·row-flightS‚ yea often
scarce five hundred casts of a javelin3 and yet between them and
the sun lie immense levels of sea, spread out below the huge
borders of ether, and many thousands of lands are between, held
