the hollow pipe stirs their minds in Phrygian mood. They carry
weapons before them, emblems of furious rage, meet to fill the
thankless souls and godless 11163515 of the rabble with terror for
the divinity of the goddess. Therefore when first borne in pro-
cession through great cities she mutely enriches mortals with a
blessing not expressed in words, they straw all her path with brass
and silvei· presenting her with bounteous 311115, and scatter over
her a snow-shower of 10565, o’ershadowing the mother and her
troops of attendants. Here an armed band to which the Greeks
give the name of Phrygiam Curetes, in that it haply joins in the
game of arms and springs up in measure all dripping with blood,
shaking with its nodding the frigrhtful crests upon the head, 16-
presents the Dictaean Curetes who, as the story 15, 6151 drowned in
Crete that infant cry of Jove, when the young band about the

their country and be ready to be a safeguard and an ornament to
their parents. All which, well and beautifully as it 15 561 forth

with supreme repose, far removed and withdrawn from our con-
cerns; since exempt from every pain, exempt from all dangers,
strong in its own resources, not wanting aught of us, it is neither
gained by favours nor moved by anger. And here if any one
thinks proper to call the sea Neptune and corn Ceres and chooses
rather to misnse the name of Bacchus than to utter the term that
belongs to that liquor, let us allow him to declare that the earth
is mother of the gods, if he only foi-bear in earnest to stain his
mind with foul religion. The earth however is at all time without
feeling, and because it receives into it the first-beginnings of
many things, it brings them forth in many ways into the light of
the sun.

And so the woolly flocks and the martial breed of horses and
horned herds, though often cropping the grass from one field be-
neath the same canopy of heaven and slaking their thirst from
