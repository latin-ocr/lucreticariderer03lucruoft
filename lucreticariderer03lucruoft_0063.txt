mansion might enlarge its expanse and raise its high vaults far
above earth, and that air might rise up around. For all bodies
from all quarters are assigned by blows each to its appropriate
thing and all withdraw to their proper classes; moisture passes
to moisture, from an earthy body earth increases and fires forge
fires and ether ether, until nature parent of things with finish-
ing hand has brought all things on to their utmost limit of
growth. And this comes to pass when that which is infused
into the life—arteries is no more than that which ebbs from
them and withdraws: at this point the life-growth in all things
must stop, at this point nature by her powers checks further
increase. For whatever things you see grow in size with joyous
increase and mount by successive steps to mature age, take to
themselves more bodies than they discharge from themselveS,
while food is readily infused into all the arteries and the things
are not so widely spread 0111 65 10 throw off many particles and
occasion more waste than their age can take in as nourishment.
For no doubt it must be conceded that many bodies ebb away
and withdraw from things3 but still more must join them, until
they have touched the utmost point of growth. Then piece by
piece age breaks their powers and matured strength and wastes
away 011 1116 side of decay. For the larger a thing is and the
wider, as soon as its growth is stopped, at once it sheds abroad
and discharges from it more bodies in all directions round3 and
its food is not readily transmitted into all its arteries and is not
enough, in proportion to the copious exhalations which the thing
throws off, to enable a like amount to rise up and be supplied.
For food must keep all things entire by renewing them, food must
uphold, food sustain all things: all in vain, since the arteries
refuse to hold what is sufficient, and nat-ure does not furnish the
needful amount. With good reason therefore all things perish,
when they have been rarefied by the ebb of particles and suc-
cumb to blows from without, since food sooner or later fails
advanced age, and bodies never cease to destroy a thing by
thumping it from without and to overpower it by aggressive
blows. In this way then the walls too of the great world around
shall be stormed and fall to decay and crumbling ruin. Yes and
even now the age 15 enfeebled and the earth exhausted by bear-
ing scarce produces little living creatures, she who produced all
