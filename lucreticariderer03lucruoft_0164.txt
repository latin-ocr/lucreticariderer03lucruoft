are led all the farther astray by blind reason. Now unless you
drive from your mind with loathing all these thingS, and banish
far from you all belief in things degrading to the gods and incon-
sistent with their peace, then often will the holy deities of the
gods, having their majesty lessened by you, do you hurt; not
that the supreme power of the gods can bc so outraged, that in
their wrath they shall resolve to exact sharp vengeamce, but
because you will fancy to yourself that they, though they enjoy
quiet and calm peace, do roll great billows of wrath3 nor will you
approach the sanctuarios of the gods with a calm brcast nor will
you be able with tramfflil peace of mind to take in those idols
which are carried from their holy body into the minds of men, as
heralds of their divine form. And what kind of life follows after
this, may be oonceived. But in order that most veracious reason
may drive it far away from us, though much has already gone forth
from 1110, much however still remains and has to be embellished

or to which of the two halves it has betaken itself, in what way it
has gained an entrance within walled places, and how after
lording it with tyrant sway, it has gotten itself out from these.
Do thou, deft muse Calliope, solace of men and joy of gods, point
out the coursebefore 1110 as I race to the white boundary-line
of the final goal, that under thy guidance I may win the crown
with signal applause.

In the first place the blue of heaven is shaken with thunder,
because the ethereal clouds clash together as they fly aloft when
the winds combat from opposite quarters. For no sound ever
comes from a clondssess part of heaven, but wheresoever the clouds
are gathered in a denser mass, from that part with greater fre-
quency comes a clap with a loud growl. Again clouds cannot be
either of so dense a body as stones and timbers‚ nor again so fine
as mists and flying bodies of smoke3 for then they must either
fall borne down by their dead weight like stones‚ or like smoke
they would be unable to keep together and hold within fiozen
snows and hail-showers. They also give forth a sound over the
