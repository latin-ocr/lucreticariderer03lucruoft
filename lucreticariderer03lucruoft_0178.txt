then passes anew over the lands in a fresh current, where a

And now I will explain why it is that fires breathe forth at
times through the gorges of mount Aetna with such hurricane-
like fury3 for with a destroying force of no ordinary kind the
fialne-storm gathered itself up and lording it over the lands of
the Sicilians drew on itself the gaze of neighbouring nations, when
seeing all the quarters of heaven smoke and sparkle men were
filled in heart with awe-struck apprehenshm, not knowing what
strange change nature was travailing to work.

In these matters you must look far and deep and make a

fire of Aetna to overflow‚ the heaven to be in flames3 for that too
is seen and the heavenly quarters are on fire; and rain-storms
gather in a heavier mass, when the seeds of water have haply
come together for such an end. ‘Ay but the stormy rage os the
conflagrationis too too gigantic.' Yes and so any river you like
is greatest to him who has never before seen any greater, and thus
