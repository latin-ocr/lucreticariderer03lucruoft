clear bright fire flies through by the pores. And it breaks to
pieces many things, when the first bodies of the thunderbolt have
fallen exactly on the first bodies of these things at the points
where they are intertwined and held together. Again it easily
melts brass and fuses gold in an instant, because its force is formed
of bodies minutely small and of smooth elements, which easily
make their way in and when they are in, in a moment break up
all the knots and untie the bonds of union. And more especially
in autumn the mansion of heaven studded with glittering stars and
the whole earth are shaken on all sides, and also when the flowery
season of spring discloses itsclf. For during the cold fires are
wanting and winds fail during the beat, and the clouds then are
not of so dense a body. When therefore the seasons of heaven are
between the two extremes, the different causes of thunder and
lightning all combine3 for the very cross—current of the year mixes
up cold and hcat, both of which a cloud needs for forging thunder-
bolts3 so that there is great discors] in things and the air raving
with fires and winds heaves in mighty disorder. The first part of
heat and the last of cold is the spring-time ; therefore unlike things
must battle with one another and be turbulent when mixed toge-
ther. And when the last heat mixed with the first cold rolls on its
course, a time which goes by the name of autumn, then too fierce
winters are in conflict with summers. Therefore these seasons are
to be called the cross-seas of the year; and it is not wonderful that
in that scason thunderbolts are most frequent and troublous storms
are stirred up in heaven3 since both sides then engage in the
troublous medley of dubious war, the one armed with flames, the
other with winds and water commingled.

This is the way to see into the true nature of the thunderbolt
and to understand by what force it produces each effect, and not
the turning over the scrolls of Tyrrhene charms and vainly search-
ing for tokens of the hidden will of the gods, in order to know
from what quarter the volant fire has come or to which of the two
halves it has betaken itself, in what way it has gained an entrance
within walled places, and how after lording it with tyrant sway it
has gotten itself out from these; also what harm the thunderstroke
from heaven can do. But if Jupiter and other gods shake with
an appalling crash the glittering quarters of heaven, and hur]
their fire whither each is so minded, why strike they not those
