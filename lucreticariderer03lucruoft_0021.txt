F irst bodies therefore are solid and without void. Again since
there is void in things begotten, solid matter must exist about
this void, and no thing can be proved by true reason to conceal
in its body and have within it void, unless you choose to allow
that that which holds it in is solid. Again that can be nothing
but a union of matter which can keep in the void of things.
Matter therefore, which consists of a solid body, may be ever-
lasting, though all things else are dissolved. Moreover if there
were no empty void, the universe would be solid, unless on the
other hand there were certain bodies to fill up whatever places
they occupied, the existing universe would be empty and void
space. Therefore sure enough body and void are marked off
in alternate layers, since the universe is neither of a perfect
fulness nor a perfect void. There are therefore certain bodies
which can vary void space with full. These can neither be
broken in pieces by the stroke of blows from without nor have
their texture undone by aught piercing to their core nor give way
before any other kind of assault3 as we have proved to you a
little before. For without void nothing seems to admit of being
crushed in or broken up or split in two by cutting, or of taking in
wet or permeating cold or penetrating fire, by which all things are
destroyed. And the more anything contains within it of void, the
more thoroughly it gives way to the assault of these things.
Therefore if first bodies are as I have shewn solid and without
void, they must be evei-lasting. Again unless matter had been
eternal, all things before this would have utterly returned to
nothing and whatever things we see would have been born anew
from nothing. But since I have proved above that nothing can
be produced from nothing, and that what is begotten cannot be
recalled to nothing, first-beginnings must be of an imperishable
body, into which all things can be dissolved at their last honr„
that there may be a supply of matter for the reproduction of
things. Therefore first-beginnings are of solid singleness‚ and in
no other way can they have been preserved through ages during
infinite time past in order to reproduce things.

Again if nature had set no limit to the breaking of things, ,
by this time the bodies of matter would have been so far reduced
by the breaking of past ages that nothing could within a fixed
time be conceived out of thern and reach its utmost growth of
