piled up on high one above the other in marvellous accumu-
lation3 that you be not led into error, because we see how great
their breadth is below, rather than to how great a height they
are piled up. Observe, at a time when the winds shall carry
clouds like to mountains with a slanting course through the air,
01 when you shall see them piled on the sides of great moun-
tains one on the top of the other and pressing down from above
perfectly at rest, the winds being buried on all sides: you will
then be able to observe their great masses and to see caverns as
it were built of hanging rocks3 and when a storin has gathered
and the winds have filled these, they chafe with a loud roaring
shut up in the clouds, and bluster in their dens after 1110 fashion
of wild beasts: now 110111 this point, now from that the winds
send their growlings through the clouds, and secking a way out
whirl about and roll together seeds of fire out of the clouds and
then gather many into a mass and make flame rotate in the hol-
low furnaces within, until they have burst the cloud and 5110110
forth in forked fiashes.

From this cause again yon golden colour of clear bright fire
flies down with velocity to the earth: the clouds must themselves
have very many seeds of fire3 for when they are without any
moisture, they are mostly of a brilliant flame colour. Moreover
they must take in many from the sun's light, 50 11101 with good
cause they are ruddy and shed forth fires. When therefore the
wind has driven thrust squeezecl together ancl collected into one
spot these clouds, they press out and shed forth seeds which cause
the colours of flame to flash out. It 0150 lightens, when the clouds
of heaven are rarefied 05 well. For when the wind lightly unravels
them and breaks them up as they move, those seeds which produce
the lightning must fall perforce3 and then it lightens without a
hideous startling 110150 and without any uproar.

well, to proceed, what kind of nature thunderbolts possess, is
shewn by their strokes and the traces of their heat which have
burnt themselves into things and the marks which exhale the
noxious vapours of sulphur: all these are signs of fire, not of wind
or rain. Again they often set on fire even the roofs of houses and
with swift fiame rule resistless within the house. This fire subtle
above all fires nature, you are to know, forms of minute and lightly
moving bodies, and it 15 such as nothing whatever can withstand.
