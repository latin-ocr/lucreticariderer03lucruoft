the open doors do not therefore undergo any fatigue. Again if
our eyes are in the place of doors, in that case when the eyes
are removed the mind ought it would soem to have more power of
seeing things, after doors, jambs and all, have been taken out of
the way.

And herein you must by no means adopt the opinion which
the revered judgment of the worthy man Democritus lays down,
that the first-beginnings of body and mind placed together in
successive layers come in alternate order and so weave the tissue

of our limbs. For not only are the elements of the soul much
smaller than those of which our body and flesh are formed, but
they are also much fewer in number and are disseminated merely
in scanty number through the frame, so that you can warrant no
more than this: the first-beginnings of the soul keep spaces be-
tween them at least as great as are the smallest bodies which, if
thrown upon it, are first able to excite in our body the sense-
giving motions. Thus at times we do not feel the adhesion of dust
when it settles on our body, nor the impact of chalk when it
rests on our limbs, nor do we feel 3 mist at night nor a spider's
slender threads as they come against us, when we are caught in
its meshes in moving along, nor the same insectâ€™s flimsy web when
it has fallen on our head, nor the feathers of birds and down
of plants as it fiies about, which commonly from exceeding
lightness does not lightly fall, nor do we feel the tread of every
creeping creature whatsoever nor each particular foot-print which
gnats and the like stamp on our body. So very many first-
beginnings must be stirred in us, before the seeds of the soul
mixed up in our bodies feel that these have been disturbed, and
by thumping with such spaces between can clash unite and in
turn recoil.

The mind has more to do with holding the fastnesses of life
and has more sovereign sway over it than the power of the soul.
For without the understanding and the mind no part of the 50111
0311 maintain itself in the frame the smallest fraction of time, but
follows at once in the other's train and passes away into the air
and leaves the cold limbs 111 the chill of death. But he abides in
life whose mind and understanding continue to stay with him:
though the trunk is mangled with its limbs shorn all round about
it, after the soul has been taken away on all sides and been
