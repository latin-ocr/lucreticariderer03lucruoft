voices, when you sent forth one: in such wisc did thc very hills
dash back on hills and repeat the words thus trained to come
back. These spots the people round fancy that the goat-footed
satyrs and nymphs inhabit, and tell that they are the fauns by
whose night-pervading noisc and sportive play as they ‹lcclare the
still silence is broken and sounds produced of stringcd instru-
ments and sweet plaintive melodias, such as the pipe pours forth
when beaten by the fingers 01 the players; the country-people
hearing far and wide, what time Pan nodding the piny covering of
his head 11311 3 beast's oft runs over the gaping reeds with curved
lip, making the pipe without ceasing to pour forth its wood-
land song. Other such like prodigies and rnarvels they tell of,
that they may not haply be thought to inhabit lonely places,
abandoned even by the gods. On this account they vaunt such
wonders in their stories or are led on by some other reason;
inasmuch as the whole race 01 man is all too greedy after listen-
ing ears.

To proceed, you need not wonder how it is that through
places, through which the eyes cannot see plain things, voices
come and strike the ears. We often see a conversation go on
even through closed doors, sure enough because the voice can
pass uninjured through the winding openings of things, while idols
refuse to pass: they are torn to shreds, 11 the openings through
which they glide are not straight, like those of glass‚ through
which every image passes. Again a voice distributes itself in
all directions, since voices are begotten one out 01 another, when
a single voice has once gone forth and sprung into many, 33 a
spark of fire is often wont to distribute itself into its constituent
fires. Therefore places are filled with voices, which though 131
withdrawn out of view yet are all in commotion and stirred by
sound. But idols all proceed in straight courses as 30011 33 they
have been discharged3 and therefore you can never see beyond a
wall, but you may hear voices outside it. And yet this very voice
even in passing through the walls of houses is blunted and enters
the ears in a huddled state, and we seem to hear the sound rather
than the actual words.

The tongue and palate whereby we perceive flavour, have not
in them anything that calls for longer explanation or offers more
difficulty. In the first place we perceive flavour in the mouth
