BOOK FIFTH

Who is able with powerful genius 10 frame 6 poem worthy of
1116 grandeur of 1116 things and these disooveries? or who is so
great 6 master of words as 10 be able 10 devise praises equal 10
the (1656115 of him who lest 10 115 such prizes won and earned
by his own genius? None methinks who is formed of 11101161
body. For if we 1111151 speak as 1116 aoknowledged grandeur of
1116 things itself demands, 6 god he was, 6 god, 111051 noble Mem-
