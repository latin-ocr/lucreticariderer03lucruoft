fraught with heat it increases to such a degree the stroke of
the rays.

Nor with regard to the sun is there one single explanation,
certain and manifest, of the way in which he passes from his
summer positions to the midwinter turning-point of capricorn
and then coming back from thence bends his course to the sol-
stitial goal of cancer, and how the moon is seen once a month
to pass over that space, in traversing which the sun spends the
period of a year. No single plain cause, I say, has been assigned
for these things. It seems highly probable that that may be the
truth which the revered judgment of the worthy man Democritus
maintains: the nearer the different constellations are to the earth,
the less they can be carried along with the whirl of heaven ; for
the velocity of its force, he says, passes away and the intensity
diminishes in the lower parts, and therefore the sun is gradually
left behind with the rearward signs, because he is much lower
than the burning signs. And the moon more than the sun: the
lower her path is and the more distant she is from heaven and
the nearer she approaches to earth, the less she can keep pace
with the signs. For the fainter the whirl is in which she is borne

⁴ along, being as she is lower than the sun, so much the more all

the signs around overtake and pass her. Therefore it is that she
appears to come back to every sign more quickly, because the
signs go more quickly back to her. It is quite possible too that
from quarters of the world crossing the sun's path two airs may
stream each in its turn at a fixed time3 one of which may force
the sun away from the summer signs so far as his midwinter turn-
ing-point and freezing cold, and the other may force him back
from the freezing shades of cold as far as the heat-laden quarters
and burning signs, And in like manner we must suppose that the
moon, and the stars which make revolutions of great years in
great orbits may pass by means of airs from opposite quarters in
turn. See you not too that clouds from contrary winds pass in
contrary directions, the upper in a contrary way to the lower?
Why may not yon stars just as well be borne on through their
grcat orbits in ether by currents contrary one to the other?

But night buries the earth in thick darkness, either when the
sun after his long course has struck upon the utmost parts of
heaven and now exhausted has blown forth all his fires shaken
