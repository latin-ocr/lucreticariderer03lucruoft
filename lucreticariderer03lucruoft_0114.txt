106 IV 907—9⁴8

Now by what means yon slccp lets a stream of repose over
the limbs and dispels from the breast the cares of the mind, I
will tell in sweetly worded rather than in many verses; 33 the
short song of the swan is bcttcr than the loud noise of cranes
scattered abi-oud amid the ethei-eal clouds of the south. Do you
lcnd me a nice ear and a keen mind, that you may not deny
what I say to be possible and secede with breast disdainfully
rejecting the words of truth, you yoursclf being in fault the while
and unable to discern. Sleep mainly takes place when the force
of the soul has been scattered about through the frame, and in
part has been forced abroad and taken its departure, and in part
has been thrust back and has withdrawn into the depths of the
body: after ‘that the limbs arc relaxcd and droop. For there 13
110 doubt that this sense exists in us by the agency of the 30111 ;
31111 when sleep obstructs the action of this sense, then we must
assume that our soul has been disordered and forced abroad3 not
indeed all; for then the body would 116 steeped in the everlasting
chill of death. XVhere no part of the soul remained behind con·
cealed in the limbs, as 1116 remains concealed when buried under
much ash, whence could sense be suddenly rekindled through the
11111113, 33 flame can spring up from hidden fire?

But by what means this change of condition 13 accomplished
and from what the 30111 6311 116 disordered and the body grow
faint, I will explain: do you mind that I waste not my words
011 the wind. In the first place the body in its outer side, since
it is next to and 13 touched by the air, must be thumped and
beaten by its repeated blows; and for this reason all things as
a rule are covered either by a hide or else by shells or by a
callous skin or by bark. YVhen creatures breathe, this air at the
same time buffets the inner side also, as it is inhaled and exhaled.
Therefore since the body is beaten on both sides alike and blows
arrive by means of the small apertures at the primal parts and
primal elements of our body, there gradually ensues a sort of
breaking up throughout our limbs, the arrangements of the first-
beginnings of body and mind getting disordered. Then next a
part of the soul is forced out and a part withdraws into the inner
recesses; a part too scattered about through the frame cannot get
united together and so act and be acted upon by motion; for
nature intercepts all communication and blocks up all the pas-
