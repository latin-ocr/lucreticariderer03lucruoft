away leaving great spaces between, therefore thus shut in they
make those sense-giving motions which they cannot make after
death when forced out of the body into the air by reason that
they are not then confined in a like manner3 for the air will be
a body and a living thing, if the 50111 shall be able to keep
itself together and to enclose in it those motions which it used
before to perform in the sinews and within the body. Moreover
even while it yet moves within the confines of life, often the
50111 shaken from some cause or other is seen to wish to pass
out and be loosed from the whole body, the features are seen
to droop as at the last hour and all the limbs to sink flaccid
over the bloodless trunk: just as happens, when the phrase is
used, the mind 15 111 5 bad way, or the 50111 15 quite goneg
when all is hurry and every one 15 anxious to keep from parting
the last tie of life 3 for then the mind and the power of the 50111
are shaken throughout and both are quite loosened together
with the body3 50 that a cause somewhat more powerful can
quite break them up. Why doubt I would ask that the soul
when driven forth out of the body, when in the open air, feeble
as it is, stript of its covering, not only cannot continue through
eternity, but 15 unable to hold together the smallest fraction of
time? Therefore, again and again I say, when the enveloping
body has been all broken up and the vital airs have been forced
out, you must admit that the 5511555 of the mind and the 50111 515
dissolved, since the cause of destruction is one and inseparable for
both body and soul.

Again since the body 15 unable to bear the separation of the
50111 without rotting away in a noisome stench, why doubt that
the power of the 50111 gathering itself up from the inmost depths
of body has oozed out and dispersed like smoke, and that the
crumbling body has changed and tumbled in with so total a
ruin for this reason because its foundations throughout are stirred
from their places, the soul oozing out abroad through the frame,
through all the winding passages which are in the body, and all
openings? so that in ways manifold you may learn that the
nature of the soul 1155 115511 divided piecemeal and gone forth
throughout the frame, and that it has been torn to shreds within
the body, ere it glided forth and swam out into the air. For no
one when dying appears to feel the 50111 go forth entire from his
