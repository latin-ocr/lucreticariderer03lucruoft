would give forth neither severe colds nor excessivo heats nor gales
of great violence; for all things grow and acquire strength in a
like proportion.

Wherefore again and again I say the earth with good title
has gotten and keeps the name of mother, since she of herself
gave birth to mankind and at a time nearly fixed shed forth
every beast that ranges wildly over the great mountains, and at
the same time the fowls of the air with all their varied shapes.
But because she must have some limit set to her bearing, she
ccased like a woman worn out by length of days. For time
changes the nature of the whole world and all things must pass
on from one condition to another, and nothing continues like to
itself: all things quit their bounds‚ all things nature changes and
compels to alter. One thing crumbles away and is worn and en-

nature of the whole world and the earth passes out of one con-

order to be able to bear what before it did not bear.

And many monsters too the earth at that tinne essayed to
produce, things coming up with strange face and limbs, the man-
woman, a thing between the two and neither the one sex nor
the other, widely differing from both3 some things deprived of

the adhesion of their limbs over all the body, so that they could
not do anythingfnor go anywhere nor avoid the evil nor take what
their needs required. Every other monster and portent of this
kind she would produce, but all in vain, since nature set a ban
on their increase and they could not reach the coveted flower of
age nor find food nor be united in marriage. For we see that
many conditione must meet together in things in order that they
may beget and continue their kinds; first a supply of food, then
a way by which the birth-producing seeds throughout the frame,
may stream from the relaxed limbs; also in order that the woman
may be united with the male, the possession of organs whereby
they may each interchange mutual joys

And many races of living things must then have died out and
been unable to beget and continue their breed. For in the case
