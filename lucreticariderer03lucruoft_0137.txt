which of them it is, is by no means the duty of the man who
advances step by step.

And in order that the earth may rest in the middle of the
world, it is proper that its weight should gradually pass away
and be lessened, and that it should have another nature under-
neath it conjoined from the beginning of its existence and formed
into one being with the airy portions of the world in which it
is embodied and lives. For this reason it is no burden and does
not weigh down the air; just as his limbs are of no weight to
a man nor is his head a burden to his neck, nor do we feel that
the whole weight of the body rests on the feet; but whatever
weights come from without and are laid upon us, hurt us though
they are often very much smaller: of such great moment it is
what function each thing has to perform. Thus then the earth
is not an alien body suddenly brought in and forced from some
other quarter on air alien to it, but was conceived together with
it at the first birth of the world and is a fixed portion of that
world, just as our limbs are seen to be to us. Again the earth
when suddenly shaken by loud thunder shakes by its motion all
the things which are above it3 and this it could in no wise do,
unless it had been fast bound with the airy portions of the world
and with heaven. For the earth and they cohere with one an-
other by common 100135, conjoined and formed into a single being
from the beginning of their existence. See you not too that
great as 15 the weight of our body, the force of the 50111, though
of the extremest 1111511555, supports it, because it is so closely
conjoined and formed into a single being with it? Then too what
is able to lift the body with a nimble bound save the force of
the mind which guides the limbs? Now do you see what power
a subtle nature may have, when it is conjoined with a heavy
body, as the air is conjoined with the earth and the force of the
mind with us?

Again the disk of the sun cannot be much larger nor its
body of heat much smaller, than they appear to be to our senses.
F‘or from whatever distances fires can reach us with their light
and breathe on our limbs burning heat, those distances take away
nothing by such spaces between from the body of the flames, the
fire is not in the least narrowed in appearance. Therefore since
the heat of the sun and the light which it sheds reach our senses
