This too you may sometimes say to yourself, ‘even worthy
Ancus has quitted the light with his eyes, who was far far better
than thou, unconscionable man. And 511106 111611 many other
kings and kesars have been laid low, who lordcd it over mighty
nations. He too, even he who erst paved a way over the great
sea and made a path for his legions to march over the deep and
taught them to pass 0111001 over the salt pools and set at
naught the roarings of the sea, trampling on them with his

110111 1115 dying body. The son of the Scipios‚ thunderbolt of
war, terror of Carthage, yielded his bones to earth just as 11 116
were the lowest menial. Think 100 01 1116 inventors of all
sciences and 81606161 6115, think of 1116 companions of the Heli-
conian maids3 among whom Homer bore the sceptre without a
peer‚ and he now sleeps the 561116 516611 65 others. Then there
15 Democritus who, when a ripe old 686 had warned him that
the memory-waking motions of his mind were waning, by his
own spontaneous 601 offered up his head 10 death. Even Epicurus
passed away, when his light of life had run 115 006156, 116 who
surpassed in intellect the 1606 01 man and quenched the light of
all, 65 1116 6131161661 5611 6115611 quenches the 51615. Wilt thou
then hesitate and think it 6 1161(1511111 10 die 2 thou for whom life
is well nigh dead whilst yet thou livest and seest the light, who
spendest the greater part of thy time in sleep and snorest wide
awake and 0665651 1101 10 566 visions and 11651 6 mind troubled
with groundless terror and 061151 1101 discover often what it 15
11161 6115 11166, when besotted man thou art 5016 pressed on all
sides with full many cares and goest astray tumbling 611061 111
the wayward wanderings of thy mind.

If, just as they are seen to feel that a load 15 011 111611 mind
which wears them out with its pressure, men might apprehend
from what causes too it 15 produced and whence such a pile, if I
may say 50, 01 111 1165 011 111611 1116651, they would not spend their
life 65 we see them now 101 1116 111051 part do, not knowing any
