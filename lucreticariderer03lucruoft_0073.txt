adhere together with common roots and cannot it is plain be riven
asunder without destruction. Even as it is not easy to pluck the
perfume out of lumps of frankincense without quite destroyi'ng its
nature as well; so it is not easy to withdraw from the whole body
the nature of the mind and soul without dissolving all alike.
With first-beginnings so interlaced from their earliest birth are
they formed and gifted with a life of joint partnership, and it is
plain that the faculty of the body and of the mind cannot feel
separately, each alone without the other's power, but sense is
kindled throughout our flesh and blown into fiame between tho
two by the joint motions on the part of both. Moreover the body
by itself is never either begotten or grows or, it is plain, continues
to exist after death. For not in the way that the liquid of water
often loses the beat which has been given to it, yet is not for
that reason itself riven in pieces, but remains unimpaired‚—not
in this way, I say, can the abandoned frame endure the separation
of the soul, but riven in pieces it utterly perishes and rots away.
Thus the mutual connexions of body and soul from the first
moment of their existence learn the vital motions even while hid
in the body and womb of the mother, so that no separation can
take place without mischief and ruin. Thus you may see that,
since the cause of existence lies in their joint action, their nature
too must be a joint nature.

F urthermore if any one tries to disprove that the body feels
and believes that the soul mixed through the whole body takes
upon it this motion which we name sense, he combats even mani-
fest and undoubted facts. For who will ever bring forward any
explanation of what the body's feeling is, except that which the
plain fact of the case has itself given and taught to us? But when
the soul it is said has departed‚ the body throughout is without
sense; yes, for it loses what was not its own peculiar property
in life; ay and much else it loses, before that soul is driven
out of it.

Again to say that the eyes can 566 no object, but that the
soul discerns through them as through an open door, is far from
easy, since their sense contradicts this; for this sense e'en draws it
and forces it out to the pupil: nay often we are unable to perceive
shining things, because our eyes are embarrassed by the lights.
But this is not the case with door-33 for, because we ourselves see,
