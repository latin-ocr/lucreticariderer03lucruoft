will be nothing to which we can appeal on hidden things in order
to prove anything by reasoning of mind. Then again, if room and
space which we call void did not exist, bodies could not be placed
anywhere nor move about at all to any side ς 35 we have demon-
strated to you a little before. Moreover there is nothing which
you can affirm to be at once separate from all body and quite
distinct from void, which would so to say count as the discovery
of a third nature. For whatever shall exist, this of itself must
be something or other. Now if it shall admit of touch in however
slight and small a measure, it will, be it with a large or be it with
a little addition, provided it do exist, increase the amount of body
and join the sum. But if it shall be intangible and unable to
hinder any thing from passing through it on any side, this you
are to know will be that which we call empty void. Again what-
ever shall exist by itself, will either do something or will itself
suffer by the action of other things, or will be of such a nature
as things are able to exist and go on in. But no thing can do
and suffer without body, nor aught furnish room except void and
vacancy. Therefore beside void and bodies no third nature taken
by itself can be left 111 the number of things, either such as to
fall at any time under the ken of our senses or such as any one
0311 grasp by the reason of his mind.

For whatever things are named, you will either find to be
properties linked to these two things or you will see to be ac-
cidents of these things. That is a property which can in no case
be disjoined and separated without utter destruction accompany-
ing the severance, such as the weight of a stone, the heat of fire,
the fluidity of water. Slavery on the other hand, poverty and
riches, liberty war concord and all other things which may come
and go while the nature of the thing remains unharmed‚ these
we are wont, as it is right we should, to call accidents. Time also
exists not by itself, but simply from the things which happen the
sense apprehends what has been done in time past, as well as
what is present and what is to follow after. And we must admit
that no one feels time by itself abstracted from the motion and
calm rest of things. So when they say that the daughter of
Tyndarus was ravished and the Trojan nations were subdued in
war, we must mind that they do not force us to admit that these
things are by themselves, since those generations of men, of whom
