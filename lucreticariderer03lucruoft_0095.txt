their mind must be formed? do you not perceive how fine, how
minute they are? Again in the case of all things which exhale
from their body a pungent smeH, all-heal, nauseous wormwood, '
strong-scented southernwood and the bitter centauries‚ any one of
which, if you happen to [feel it] lightly between two [fingers, will
impregnate them with a strong smell] ae* but rather you are to
know that idols of things wander about many in number in many
wayS, of no force, powerless to excite sense.

But lest haply you suppose that only those idols of things
which go off from things and no others wander about, there are
likewise those which are spontaneously begotten and are formed
by themselves in this lower heaven which is called air: these
fashioned in many ways are borne along on high and being in a
fluid state cease not to alter their appearance and change it into
the outline of shapes of every possible kind; as we see clouds
sometimes gather into masses on high and blot the calm clear
face of heaven, fanning the air with their motion. Thus often the
faces of giants are seen to fly along and draw after them a far-
spreading shadow; sometimes great mountains and rocks torn
from the mountams are seen to go in advance and pass across the
sun3 and then some huge beast is observed to draw with it and
bring on the other storm-clouds.

Now [I will proceed to shew] with what ease and celerity they
are begotten and how incessantly they flow and fall away from
things. The outermost surface is ever streaming off from things
and admits of being discharged: when this reaches some things,
it passes through them, glass especially. But when it reaches
rough stones or the matter of wood, it is then so torn that it
cannot give back any idol. But when objects at once shining and
dense have been put in its way, a mirror especially, none of these
results has place: it can neither pass through it, like glass, nor
can it be torn either; such perfect safety the polished surface
minds to ensure. In consequence of this idols stream back to us
from such objects3 and however suddenly at any moment you
place any thing opposite a mirror, an image shews itself: hence
you may be sure that thin textui-es and thin shapes of things in-
cessantly stream from their surface. Therefore many idols are
begotten in a short time, so that the birth of such things is with
good reason named a rapid one. And as the sun must send forth
