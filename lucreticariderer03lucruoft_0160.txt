head and shoulders with garlands plaited with flowers and leaves,
and to advance in the dance out of step and move the limbs
clumsily and with clumsy foot beat mother earth3 which would
occasion smiles and peals of nicrry laughter‚ because all these
things then from their greater novelty and strangeness were in
high repute. And the wakeful found a solace for want of sleep ’
in this, in drawing out a variety of notes and going through
tunes and running over the reeds with curving lip; whence
even at the present day watchrnen observe these traditions and
have lately learned to keep the proper tune 3 and yet for all this
receive not a jot more of enjoyment‚ than erst the rugged race of
sons of earth received. For that which we have in our hands, if
we have known before nothing pleasanter, plcases above all and is
thought to be the best; and as a rule the later discovery of some-
thing better spoils the taste for the former things and changes
the feelings in regard to all that has gone before. Thus began
distaste for the acorn, thus were abandoned those sleeping-places
strawn with grass and enriched with leaves. The dress too of
wild beasts' skin fell into neglect ; though I can fancy that in
those days it was found to arouse such jealousy that he who first
wore it met his death by an ambuscade, and after all it was torn
in pieces among thern and drenched in blood was utterly de-
stroyed and could not be turned to any use. In those times there-
fore skins, now gold and purple plague men’s lives with cares
and wear them out with war. And in this methinks the greater
blame rests with us; for cold would torture the naked sons of
earth without their skins; but us it harms not in the least to do
without a robe of purple, spangled with gold and large figures, if
only we have a dress of the people to protect us. Mankind there-
fore ever toils vainly and to no purpose and wastes life in ground-
less careS‚ because sure enough they have not learnt what is the
true eud of getting and up to what point genuine pleasure goes on
increasing: this by slow degrees has carried life out into the deep
sea and stirred up from their lowest depths the mighty billows
of war.

But those watchful guardians sun and moon traversing with
their light all round the great revolving sphere of heaven taught

men that the seasons of the year came round and that the system
was carried on after a fixed plan and fixed order.
