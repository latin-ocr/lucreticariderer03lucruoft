the nature of things has by no means been made for us by
divine power: so great are the defects with which it is encum-
bered. In the first place of all the space which the vast reach
of heaven covers, a portion greedy mountains and forests of wild
beasts have occupied, rocks and wasteful pools take up and the
sea which holds wide apart the coasts of different lands. Next of
nearly two thirds burning heat and the constant fall of frost rob
moi-tals. What is left for tillage, even that nature by its power
would overrun with thorns, unless the force of man made head
against it, accustomed for the sake of a livelihood to groan be-
neath the strong hoe and to cut through the earth by pressing
down the plough. Unless by turning up the fruitful clods with
the share and labouring the soil of the earth we stimulate things
to rise, they could not spontaneously come up into the clear air;
and even then sometimes when things earned with great toil now
put forth their leaves over the lands and are all in blossom, either
the ethereal sun burns them up with excessive heats or sudden
rains and cold frosts cut them off, and the blasts of the winds
waste them by a furious hurricane. Again why does nature give
food and increase to the frightful race of wild beasts dangerous
to mankind both by sea and land ‚2 why do the seasons of the year
bring diseases in their train? why stalks abroad untimely death?
Then too the baby, like to a sailor cast away by the cruel waves,
lies naked on the ground, speechless, wanting every further-auce
of life, soon as nature by the throes of birth has shed him forth
from his mother’s womb into the borders of light: he fills the
room with a rueful wauling, as well he may whose destiny it is
to go through in life so many ills. But the different flocks herds
and wild beasts grow up; they want no rattles; to none of them
need be addressed the fond broken accents of the fostering nurse3
they ask not different dresses according to the season3 110 nor
do they want arms or lofty walls, whereby to protect their own,
the earth itself and nature manifold in her works producing in
plenty all things for all.

First of all, since the body of the earth and water and the
light breath of air and burning heats, out of which this sum of
things is seen to be formed, do all consist of a body that had a
birth and is mortal, the whole nature of the world must be
reckoned of a like body. For those things whose parts and mem-
