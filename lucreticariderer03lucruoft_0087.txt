sleep of death, shalt continue so to be all time to come, freed
from all distressful pains; but we with a sorrow that would not
be sated wept for thee, when close by thou didst turn to an
ashen hue on thy appalling funeral pile, and no length of days
shall pluok from our hearts our ever-during grief ¹. This question
therefore should be asked of this speaker, what there is in it 50
passing bitter, if it come in the end to sleep and rest, that any
one should pine in never-ending sorrow.

This too men often, when they have reolined at table cup
in hand and shade their brows with crowns‚ love to say from
the heart, ‘short is this enjoyment for poor weak men3 pre-
sently it will have been and never after may it be called baek'‚
As if after their death it is to be one of their ehiefest affiictions

such lengths in sickly sorrows? why bemoan and bewail death?
for say thy life past and gone has been weloome to thee and thy
blessings have not all, as if they were poured into a perforated
vessel, run through and been lost without avail: why not then
take thy departure like a guest filled with life, and with resig-

thou hast enjoyed, has been squandered and lost, and life is a
