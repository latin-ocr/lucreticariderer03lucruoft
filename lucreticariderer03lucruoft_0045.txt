their shaking voices know their horned dams and the butting
lambs the fiocks of bleating sheep: thus they run, as nature
craves, each without fail to its own udder of milk. Lastly in the
case of any kind 01 corn you like you will yet find that any one
grain is not so similar to any other in the same kind, but that
there runs through them some difference to distinguish the forms.
On a like principle of dissei-enee we see the class of shells paint
the lap 01 661111, where the sea with gentle waves beats on the
thirsty sand 01 1116 winding shore. Therefore again and again
I say it is necessary 101 like reasons that first-beginnings of things,
since they exist by nature and are not made by hand after the
exact model of one, should fly about with shapes in some cases
differing one from the other.

It is right easy 101 113 011 311611 6 principle to explain why the
fire of lightning has much more power to pierce than 01113 which
is born of carthly pinewood: you may say that the heavenly fire
of lightning subtle as it is is formed of smaller shapes and therefore
passes through openings which this our fire cannot pass born as
it is 01 woods and sprung from pine. Again light passes through
horn, but rain is thrown off. Why? but that those first bodies
01 light are smaller than 111036 01 which the nurturing liquid 01
water 13 made. And quickly as we see wines flow through a
strainer, sluggish oil 011 1116 other hand is slow 10 do so, because
sure enough it consists of elements either lai-ger in size or more
hooked and tangled in one another, and therefore it is that the
first-beginnings of things cannot so readily be separated from each
other and severally stream through the several openings of any
thing.

Moreover the liquids honey and milk excite 6 pleasant sen-
sation of tongue when held in the mouth3 but on the other hand
the nauseous nature 01 wormwood and of harsh centaury writhes
the mouth with a 1101301116 flavour3 so that you may easily see
that the things which are able to affect the senses pleasantly,
consist of smooth and round elements3 while all those on the
other hand which are found to be bitter and harsh, are held in
connexion by particles that are more hooked and 101 11113 reason
are wont to tear open passages into our senses and in entering in
to break through the body.

All things in short which are agreeahle to the senses and all
