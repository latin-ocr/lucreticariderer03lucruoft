similar to the entire living creatures. But the parts cannot
possibly have sense by themselves alone3 for all sense of the
different members has reference to something else3 nor can the
hand when severed from us nor any other part of the body
whatever by itself maintain sensation. It remains to assume
that they resemble the entire living creatures. In this case it
is necessary that they should feel the things which we feel in
the same way as we do, in order that they may be able in all
points to work in concert with the vital sense. How then can
they be called first—beginnings of things and shun the paths of
death, seeing that they are living thingS‚ and that living things
are one and the same with mortal things? Nay granting they
could do this, yet‘ by thein meeting and union they will make
nothing but a jumble and medley of living things3 just you are
to know as men cattle and wild beasts would be unable to beget
any other thing by all their mixing with one another. But if
haply they lose from their body their own sense and adopt an-
other, what use was it to assign what is again withdrawn? more-
over, the instance to which we had before recourse, inasmuch as
we see the eggs of fowls change into living chicks and worms
burst forth, when putridity has seized on the earth after exces-
sive rains, you are to know that sensations can be begotten out
of no—sensations. ⁷

But if haply any one shall say that sense so far may arise
from no—sensation by a process of change, or because it is brought
forth by a kind of birth, it will be enough to make plain and
to prove to him that no birth takes place until a union of ele-
ments has first been effected, and that nothing changes without
their having been united. Above all senses cannot exist in any
body before the nature itself of the living thing has been
begotten, because sure enough the matter remains scattered
about in air rivers earth and things produced from earth, and
has not met together and combined in appropriate fashion the
vital motions by which the all-discerning senses are kindled into
action in each living thing.

Again a blow more severe than its nature can endure, pro-
strates at once any living thing and goes on to stun all the senses
of body and mind. For the positions of the first—beginnings are
broken up and the vital motions entirely stopped‚ until the
