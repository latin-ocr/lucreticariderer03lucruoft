And now I will explain what the law of diseases is and from
what causes the force of disease may suddenly gather itself up
and bring death-dealing destruction on the race of man and the
troops of brute beasts. And first I have shewn above that there
are seeds of many things helpfnl to our life; and on the other
hand many must fly about conducing to disease and death. NVhen
these by chance have happened to gather together and have dis-
ordered the atmosphere, the air becomes distempered. And all
that force of disease and that pestilence 601116 61131161· from without
down through the atmosphere in the shape of clouds and 11116136, 01·
6166 do gather themselves up and rise out of the earth, when
soaked with wet it has contracted a taint, being beaten upon by
unseasonable rains and suns. See you not too that all who come
to a place far away from country and home are affected by the
strangeness of climate and water, because there are wide differ-
ences in such things? for what a difference may we suppose be-
tween the climate of the Biiton and that of Egypt where the pole
of heaven slants askeW‚ and again between that in Pontus and
that of Gades and so on to the iaces of men black with sun-
baked complexion 2 Now as we see these four climates under the
four opposite winds and quarters of heaven all differing from each
other, so also the complexions and faces of the 111611 are seen to
differ widely and diseases varying in kind are found to seize upon
the different races. There is the elephant disease which is gene
rated beside the streams of Nile in the midst of Egypt and no-
where else. In Attica the feet are attacked and the eyes 111
Α61166611 lands. And so diffelent places are hurtful to different
parts and membeiws the variations of air occasion that. Therefore
when an atmosphere which happens to put itself ln motion un-
suited to us and a huitful air begin to advance, they creep slowly
on in the shape of mist and cloud and disorder everything 1n their
line of advance and compel all 130 change3 and when they have at
length reached our atmosphere‚ they corrupt it too and make it
like to themselves and unsuited to us. This new destroying power
and pestilence therefore all at once either fall upon the waters or
else sink deep into the corn-crops or other food of man and pro-
vender of beast3 or else their force remains suspended within the
atmosphere, and when we inhale from it mixed airs, we must
absorb at the same time into our body those things as well. In
