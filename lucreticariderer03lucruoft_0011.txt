1135 115 powers defined, its deep-set boundary mark. Therefore
religion is put under foot and trampled upon in 111111,- us his
victory brings level with heaven.

This is what I fear herein, lest haply you should fancy that
you are entering on unholy grounds of reason and treading the
path of sin; whereas on the contrary often and often that very
religion has given birth to sinful and unholy deeds. Thus in
Aulis the 01105011 011101131115 01 1110 Danai, foremost of men, foully
polluted with Iphianassa's blood the altar of the Trivian maid.
Soon as the fillet encircling her maiden tresses shed itself in equal
lengths adown each cheek‚ and soon as she saw her father standing
sorrowful before the altars and beside him the ministering priests
hiding the knife and her countrymen at sight of her sbedding
tears, speechless in terror she dropped down on her knees and
sank to the ground. Nor aught in such a moment could it avail
the luckless girl that she had first bestowed the name of father on
the king. For lifted up in the hands of the men she was carried
shivering to the altars, not after due performance of the customary
rites to be escorted by the clear-ringing bridal song, but in the
very season of marriage, stainless maid mid the stain 01 blood, to
fall a sad victim by the sacrificing stroke of a father, that thus a
happy and prosperous departure might be granted to the fleet.
So great the evils to which religion could prompt!

You yourself some time or other overcome by the terror-speak-
ing tales of the seers will seek to fall away from us. Ay indeed
for how many dreams may they now imagine for you, enough to
upset the calculations of life and trouble all your fortunes with
sear! And with good cause3 for if men saw that there was a
fixed limit 10 111011· woeS, they would be able in some way to with-
stand the religious scruples and threatenings of the seers. As it
is, there is no way, no means of resisting‚ since they must fear
after death everlasting pains. For they cannot tell what is the
nature of the soul, whether it be born or on the contrary find its
way into men at their birth, and whether it perish together with
us when severed from us by death or visit the gloom of Orcus and
wasteful pools or by divine decree find its way into brutes in our
stead, as sang our Ennius who first brought down from delightful
Helicon a crown of unfading leaf, destined to bright renown
throughout Italian 013115 01 men. And yet with all this Ennius
