But nature parent of things was herself the first model of
sowing and first gave rise to grafting, since berries and acorns
dropping from the trees would put forth 111 due season swarms

through the unfrequented haunts of shepherds and abodes of
unearthly calm. These things would soothe and gratify their
minds when sated with food3 for then all things of this kind
are welcome. Often therefore stretched in groups on the soft
