with the pleasant honey of the 11111565, if haply by such means I
might engage your mind on my verseS‚ till you clearly perceive
the whole nature of things, its shape and frame.

But since I have taught that most solid bodies of matter fly
about for ever unvanquished through all time, mark nour, let us
unfold whether there is or is not any limit to their sum ; likewise
let us clearly 566 whether that which has been found to be void, or
room and space, in which things severally go on, is all of it altoge-
ther finite or stretches without limits and to an unfathomable depth.

ἰ Well then the existing universe is bounded in none of its
dimensions; for 111611 11 must have had an outside. Again it is
seen that there can be an outside of nothing, unless there be
something beyond to bound it, so that that is seen, farther than
which the nature of this our sense does not follow the thing.
Now since we must admit that there is nothing outside the sum,
it has no outside, and therefore is without end and limit. And it
matters not in which of its regions you take your starffi so invari-
ably, whatever position any one has taken up, he leaves the uni-
verse just as infinite as before in all directions. Ι Again if for the
moment all existing space be held to be bounded, supposing a
man runs forward to its outside borders and stands on the utmost
verge and then throws a winged javelin‚ do you choose that when
hurled with vigorous force it shall advance to the point to which
it has been sent and fly to a distance, or do you decide that some-
thing can get in its way and stop it? for you must admit and adopt
one of the two suppositions ; either of which shuts you out from
all escape and compels you to grant that the universe stretches
without 61101.Ἇ”Ε 01 whether there is something to get in its way
and prevent its coming whither it was sent and placing itself in
the point intended, or whether it is carried forward, in either case
it has not started from the end. In this way I will go on and,
wherever you have placed the outside borders, I will ask what
then becomes of the javelin. The result will be that an end can
no where be fixed, and that the room given for flight will still
prolong the power of flight. Lastly one thing is seen by the eyes
to end another thing3 air bounds off 111115, and mountains air, earth

11111115 sea and sea again all lands ; the universe however there is
nothing outside to end.
