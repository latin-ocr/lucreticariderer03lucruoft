or as if the barriers were throwu open * . And osten during
soft repose the dogs of hunters do yet all at oneo throw about
their legs and suddenly utter eries aud repeatedly suuff the air
with their nostrils, as though they had found aud were on the
tracks of wild beasts3 and aster they are awake often chase the
shadowy idols of stags, as though they saw them iu full ssight,
until they have shaken off their delusions and (tome to thein-
selves again. And the fawning brood of dogs brought up tame in
the house haste to shake their body and raise it up from the
ground, as if they beheld unknown faces and features. And the
fiereer the different breeds are, the greater rago they must dis-
play in sleep. But the various kinds of birds flee and suddenly
in the night* time trouble with their wings the groves of the gods,
when in gentle sleep hawks and pursuing birds have appeared to
shew fight and offer battle. Again the minds of men which pur-

nigh all the stream. Cleanly people often, when sound asleep,
believing that they are lifting their dress beside a urinal or the
public vessels pour forth the filtered liquid of their whole body,
and the Babylonian coverlets of surpassing brilliauey are drenehed.
Then too those, into the boiling eurrents of whose age seed is for
the first time passing, when the ripe fulness of days has produced
it in their limbs, idols eneounter from without from what body
soever‚ harbingers of a glorious face and a beautiful bloom, which
stir and excite the frame.

That seed we have spoken of before is stirred up in us, as soon
as ripe age fortifios the frame. For as different causes set in
motion and excite different things, so from man the sole influence
