any one had tastcd‚ it drooped in near-following death. Though
hardly at all in those days would any bird appear, or the sullen
breeds of wild bcasts quit the forests. Many would droop with
disease and die: above all faithful dogs would lie stretched in all
the strects and yield up breath with a struggle ; for the power of
disease would wrench life from their frame. Funerals lonely, un-
attcnded, would be hurried on with emulous haste. And no sure
and general method of cure was found3 for that which had given
to one man the power to inhale the vital air and to gaze on the
quarters of heaven, would be destruction to others and would
bring on death. But in such times this was what was deplorable
and above all eminontly heart-rending: when a man saw himself
enmeshed by the disease, as though he were doomed to death,
losing all spirit he would lie with sorrow-stricken heart, and with

tears and grief they would go home3 and in great part they would
take to their bed from sorrow. And none could be found whom
at so fearful a time neither disease nor death nor mourning
assailed.

Then too every shepherd and herdsman, ay and sturdy guider
of the bent plough sickened; and their bodies would lie huddled
together in the corners of a hut, delivered over to death by po-
verty and disease. Sometimes you might see lifeless bodies of
parents above their lifeless children, and then the reverse of this,
children giving up life above their mothers and fathers. And in
no small measure that affliction streamed from the land into the
town, brought thither by the sickenin g crowd of peasants meeting
