have mapped out all the quarters of heaven as they arc set off
with their array of signs. Or else because the air is denser in
certain parts, therefore the quivering bearn of fire is retarded
below the earth and cannot easily pass through and force its way
out to its place of rising: for this reason in winter—time nights
linger long, ere the beamy badge of day arrive. Or else, because
in the way just mentioned at alternate parts o'f the year fires
are accustomed to stream together more slowly and more quickly,
which cause the sun to rise in a certain point, therefore it is that
those appear to spcak the truth [who suppose a fresh sun to bc
born every day]

The moon may shine because struck by the sun's rays, and
turn that light every (lay more and more directly towards our
sight, in proportion as she recedes from the sun's orb, until just
opposite to him she has shone out with full light and at her
rising as she soars alost has beheld his setting3 and then by
slow steps reversing as it were her course she must in the same
way hide her light, the nearer and nearer she now glides to the
sun from a different quarter through the circle of the signs3
according to the theory of those who suppose the moon to be
like a ball and to hold on her course under the sun. She may
also very possibly revolve with her own light and display various
phases of brightness3 for there may well be another body which
is carried on and glides in her company getting before her path
and obstructing her in all manner of ways and yet cannot be
seen, because it glides on without light. She may also revolve,
like it may be to a spherical ball steeped over one half in shinin g
light, and as she rolls round this sphere she may present changing
phases, until she has turned that half which is illuminated full
towards our sight and open eyes3 then by slow steps she whirls
back and withdraws the light-fraught half of the spherical ball;
as the Babylonian science of the Chaldees refuting the system of
the astronomers essays to prove in opposition to the1n3 just as
though that which each party fights for might not be equally true,
or there were any reason why you should venture to embrace the
one theory less than the other. Again, why a new moon should
not be born every day after a regular succession of forms and
regular phases, and each day the one which is born perish and
another be produced in its room and stead, it is not easy to teach
