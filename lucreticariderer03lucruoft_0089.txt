wretch a huge stone hanging in air3 but in life rather a base-
less dread 01 1110 gods vexes mortals: the fall they sear is -such
fall 01 luck as chance brings to each. Nor do birds eat a way
into Tityos laid in Acheron, nor can they sooth to say find
during eternity food to peck under his large breast. However
huge the bulk 01 body he extends, though such as to take up
with outspread limbs not nine acres merely, but the whole
earth, yet will he not be able to endure everlasting pain and
supply food from his own body 101 ever. But he is 101 115 0
Tityos, whom as he grovels in love vultures rend and bitter
bitter anguish eats up or troubled thoughts from any other pas-
sion do rive. In life too we have a Sisyphus before our eyes
who is bent on asking 110111 1110 people the rods and 011101 axes,
and always 1011105 defeated and disappointed. For to ask for
power, which empty as it 15 15 never given, and always in the
011050 01 11 10 undergo severe 1011, 11115 15 forcing up-hill with
much effort a stone which after all rolls back again from 1110
summit and seeks in headlong haste the levels 01 1110 plain.
Then to be ever feeding the thankless nature of 1110 mind, and
never 10 fill it full and sate it with good 11111185, 05 1110 50050115
01 1110 year do for 115, when they come round and bring their
fruits and varied delights, though after all we are never filled
with the enjoyments of life, this methinks is to do what is told
of the maidens in the flower of their age, 10 keep pouring water
into a perforated vessel which in spite of all 0011 never be filled
full. Morem-er Cerberus and the furies and yon privation of
light [are idle tales, as well as all the rest, Ixion's wheel and
black] Tartarus belching forth hideous fires from his throat:
things which nowhere are nor sooth to say can be. But there
15 111 1110 a dread of punishment for evil deeds, signal as the
deeds are signal, and 101 atonement of guilt, the prison and the
frightful hurling down from the rock, scourgings, executioners,
the dungeon of the doomed, the pitch‚ the metal plate‚ torchcs;
and even though these are wanting, yet the conscience-strichen
mind through boding fears applies to 115011 goads and frightens
115011 with whips, and sees not meanwhile what end there can
be 01 1115 01 what limit at last is to be set to punishments, and
fears lest these very evils be enhanced after death. The 1110 01
10015 01 length becomes a hell here on earth.
