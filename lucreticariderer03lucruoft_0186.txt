up the earth, but thaws icc, and forces thc snows piled up high
on the high hills to mclt away benc-ath his rays; wax again
turns to liquid when placed within reach of his heat. Fire also
inclts brass and fuscs gold, but shrivcls up and draws together
hides and flesh. The liquid of water after firc hardens steel, but
sostens hides and flesh hardencd by heat. The wild olive dclights
the beai-ded she-goats as much as if the flavour it yielded were of
ambrosia and stccpcd in nectar 3 but nothing that puts forth leaf
is more bittcr to man than this food. Again a swine eschews
marjoram-oil and dreads all pcrfumcs3 for they are rank poison to
bristly swine, though they are found at times to give us as it were
fresh life. But on the other hand though mirc is to us the nastiest
filth‚ it is found to be so wclcomc to swine that they wallow in it
all over with a craving not to bc satisfied.

There is still one point lcft which it seems proper to mention,
before I come to speak of the matter in hand. Since many pores
are assigned to various things, they must possess natures differing
the one from the other and must have each its own nature, its own
clirection: thus there are in living creatures various senses, each of
which takes into it in its own peculial· way its own special object-3
for we see that sounds pass into one thing, taste from different
flavours into another thing, smells into another. Again one thing
is seen to stream through stoncs and another thing to pass through
woods, another through gold, and another still to go out through
silver and brass3 for form is seen to stream through this passage,
heat through that, and one thing is seen to pass through by
the same way more quickly than other things. The nature of the
passages, you are to know, compels it so to be, varying in manifold
wise, as we have shewn a little above, owing to the unlike nature
and textures of things.

Therefore now that these points have all been established and
arranged for us as premisses ready to our hand, for what remains,
the law will easily be explained out of them, and the whole cause
be laid open which attracts the strength of iron. First of all
there must stream from this stone very many seeds or a current
if you will which dispels with blows all the air which lies between
the stone and iron. When this space is emptied and much room
left void between, forthwith the first-beginnings of iron fall head-
long forward into the void in one mass, and in consequence the
