and strength by a speech continued without interruption from
the dawning brightness of morning to the shadow of black
night, above all if it has been poured forth with much loud
shouting. Voice therefore must be bodily, since a man by much
speaking loses a portion from his body. Next roughness of
voice comes from roughness of first-beginnings⁷ as smoothness
is produced from snioothness. Nor are the first-beginnings of
like shape which pierce the ears in these two cases: when the
trumpet brays dully in deep low tones, the barbarian country
roused echoing back the hoarse hollow sound, aud when swans
from the headstrong torrents of Helicon raise their clear-toned
‹lirge with plaintive voice.

When therefore we force these voices forth from the depths
of our body and discharge them straight out at the mouth, the
pliant tongue (left fashioner of words gives them articulate utter-
ance and the structure of the lips does its part in shaping them.
Therefore when the distance is not long between the point from
which each several voice has started and that at which it arrives,
the very words too must be plainly heard and distinguished syl-
lable by syllable; for each voice retains its structure and retains
its shape. But if the space between be more than is suitable,
the words must be huddled together in passing through much
air and the voice be disorganised in its flight through the same.
Therefore it is that you can hear a sound, yet cannot distinguish
what the meaning of the words is: so huddled and hampered is the
voice when it comes. Again a single word often stirs the ears
of a whole assembly of people, when uttered by the crier's mouth.
One voice therefore 111 a moment starts asunder into many voices,
since it distributes itself separately into all the ears, stamping
upon them the form and distinct sound of the word. But such
of the voices as do not fall directly on the ears, are carried past
and lost, fruitlessly dispersed in air: some striking upon solid
spots are thrown back and give back a sound and sometimes
mock by an echo of the word. When you fully perceive all this,
yon may explain to yourself and others how it is that in lonely
spots rocks give back in regular succession forms of words like to
those sent forth, as we seek our comrades straying about among
the darkened hills and with loud voice call upon them scattered
abroad. I have seen places give back as many as six or seven
