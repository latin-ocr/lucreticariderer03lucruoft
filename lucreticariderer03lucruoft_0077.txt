suddenly drops down before our eyeS, as by a stroke of light-
ning, and foams at the mouth, moans auid shivers through his
frame, loses his reason, stiffens his muscles, is racked‚ gasps for
breath fitfully, and vvearies his limbs with tossing. Sure enough,
because the violence of the disease spreads itself through his
frame and disorders him, he foams as he tries to eject his soul,
just as in the salt sea the waters boil with the mastering might
of the winds. A moan too is forced out, because the limbs are
seized with pain, and mainly because seeds of voice are driven
forth and are carried in a close mass out by the mouth, the road
which they are accustomed to take and where they have a well· ,
paved way. Loss of reason follows, because the powers of the
mind and soul are disordered and, as Ι 113νο 51101111, 310 riven and
forced asunder, torn 10 pieces by the same baneful malady. Thcn
after the cause of the disease has bent its course back and the
acrid humours of the distempered body return to their hiding-
places, then he first gets up like one reeling, and by little and
little 0011105 back into full possession of 1115 senses and regains
his soul. Since therefore even within the body mind and soul
are harassed by such violent distempers and so miserably racked
by sufferings, why believe that they without the body in 1110 open
air can continue existence battling with fierce winds 2 And since
we perceive that the mind is healed like the sick body, and
we see that it can be altered by medicine, this too gives warn-
ing that the mind has a mortal existence. For it is natural that
whosoever essays and attempts to change the mind or seeks to
alter any other nature you like, should add new parts or change
the arrangement of the present, or withdraw in short some tittle
from the sum. But that which is immortal wills not to 113νο
115 parts transposed nor any addition to be made nor one tit-tle
to ebb away; for whenever a thing changes and quits its proper
limits, this change is at once the death of that which was be-
fore. Therefore the mind, whether it is sick or whether it is
altered by medicine, alike, 35 Ι 113νο shewn, gives forth mox-tal
symptomS. So invariably is truth found to make head against
false reason and to cut off all retreat from the assailant and by
a two-sold refutation to put falsehood to rout.

Again we often see a man pass gradually away and limb by
limb lose vital sense3 first the toes of his feet and the 113115
