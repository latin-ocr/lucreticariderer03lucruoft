it is altogether without name3 than it nothing exists more nimble
or more fine, or of smaller or smoother elements: it first trans-
mits the sense-giving motions through the frame3 for it is first
stirred, made up as it is of small particles3 next the heat and
the unseen force of the spirit receive the motions, then the air3
then all things are set in action, the blood is stirred‚ every part
of the flesh is filled with sensation3 last of all the feeling is trans-
mitted to the bones and marrow, whether it be one of pleasure
or an opposite excitement. No pain however can lightly pierce
thus far nor any sharp malady make its way in, without all things
being so thoroughly disordered that no room is left for life and
the parts of the soul fly abroad through all the pores of the body.
But commonly a stop is put to these motions on the surface as it
were of the body : for this reason we are able to retain life.

Now though I would fain explain 111 what way these are mixed
up together, by what means united, when they exert their powers,
the poverty of my native speech deters me sorely against my will:
yet will I touch upon them and in summary fashion to the best of
my ability: the first-beginnings by their mutual motions are inter-
laced in such a way that none of them can be separated by itself,
nor can the function of any go on divided from the rest by any
interval3 but they are so to say the several powers of one body.
Even so in any flesh of living creature you please without excep-
tion there is smell and some colour and a samur, and yet out of all
these is made up one single bulk of body. Thus the heat and
the air and the unseen power of the spirit mixed together produce
a single nature, together with that nimble force which trans-
mits to them from itself the origin of moti0n; by which means
sense-giving motion first takes its rise through the fleshly frame.
For this nature lurks secreted in its inmost depths, and nothing
in our body is farther beneath all ken than it, and more than this
it is the very seul of the whole soul. Just in the same way as the
power of the mind and the function of the soul are latent in our
limbs and throughout our body, because they are each formed of
small and few bodies: even SO, you are to know, this nameless
power made of minute bodies is concealed and is moreover the
very soul so to say of the whole soul, and reigns supreme 111 the
whole body. On a like principle the spirit and air and heat must,
as they exert their powers, be mixed up together through the
