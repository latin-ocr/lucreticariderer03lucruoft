as we see that in the class of four-footed beasts snake-handed ele-
phants are elsewhere especially numerous; for India is so fenced
about with an ivory rampart made out of many thousands of these,
that its inner parts cannot be reached, so great is the quantity of
brutes, of which we see but very few samples. But yet though I
should grant this point too: be there even as you will some one
thing sole in its kind existing alone with a body that had birth,
and let no other thing resemble it in the whole world3 yet unless
there shall be an infinite supply of matter out of which it may be
conceived and brought into being, it cannot be produced, and,
more than this, it cannot have growth and food. For though I
should assume this point also that birth-giving bodies of some one
thing are tossed about in finite quantity throughout the universe,
whence, where, by what force and in what way shall they meet
together and combine in so vast a sea, such an alien medley of
matter? They have methinks no way of uniting3 but even as
when great and numerous shipwrecks have occurred, the great sea
is wont to tumble about banks rudders yards prow masts and
swimming oars, so that poop-fittings are seen floating about along
every shore and utter to mortals a warning to try to shun the
snares and violence and guile of the faithless sea, and never at any
time to trust to it, when the winning face of calm ocean laughs
treacherously; thus too if you shall once decide that certain first-
beginnings are finite, different currents of matter must scatter and
tumble them about through all time, so that they can never be
brought into union and combine, nor abidc in any union nor grow
up and increase. But plain matter of fact shews that each of
these results manifestly does take place, that things can be brought
into being and when begotten advance in growth. It is clear then
that in any class you like the first-beginnings of things are infinite,
out of which all supplies are furnished.

Thus neither can death-dealing motions keep the lnastery
always nor entomb existence for evermore, nor on the other hand
can the birth and increase giving motions of things preserve them
always after they are born. Thus the war of first-beginnings
waged from eternity is carried on with dubious issue: now here
now there the life-bringing elements of things get the mastery
and are o‘ermastered in turn: with the funeral wail blends the
cry which babies raise when they enter the borders of light-13 and
