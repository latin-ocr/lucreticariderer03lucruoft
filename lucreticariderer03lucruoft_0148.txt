over them, nor any misgiving that never-ending night would cover
the earth and the light of the sun be withdrawn for evermore.
But what gave them trouble was rather the raccs of wild beasts
which would often render repose fatal to the poor wretcheS. And
driven from their home they would fly from their rocky shelters
on the approach of a foaming boar or a strong lion, and in the
<lead of night thoy would surrender in terror to their savage guests
their sleeping-places strawn with leaves.

Nor then much more than now would the races of mortal men
leave the sweet light of ebbing life. For then this one or that
other one of them would be more likely to bo seizcd, and torn
open by their teeth would furnish to the wild beasts a living
swod, and would fill with his meaning woods and mountains and
forests as *he looked on his living flesh buried in a living grave.
But those whom ssight had saved with body caten into, holding

contrary 'tis plenty sinks into ruin. They unwittingly would
often pour out poison for themselves3 now with nicer skill men

Next after they had got themselves huts and skins and fire,
and the woman united with the man passed with him into one

and they saw an offspring born from them, then first mankind
began to sosten. For fire made their chilled bodies less able now
to bear the frost beneath the canopy of heaven, and Venus im-

down the haughty temper of parents. Then too neighbours began
