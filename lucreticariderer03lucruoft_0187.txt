ring itself follows and then goes 011 with its whole body. And
nothing has its primal elements more intricately entangled or
coheres in closer connexion than the nature of stubborn iron and
its coldness that makes you shiver. Therefore what I say is the
less strange, that from among such elements as these bodies can-
not gather in large numbers out of the 11011 and be carried into
the void without the whole ring following. This it does do, and
follows on until it has quite reached the stone and fastened on it
with unseen bonds of connexion. The same thing takes place in
all directions ε 011 whatever side a void is formed, whether athwart
or from above the first bodies next it are at once carried on into
the void3 sor they are set in motion by blows from another
source and cannot by their own free act rise up into the air.
Moreover (to render it more feasible, this thing also is helped
on by external aid 31101 motion) as soon as the air in front of the
ring has been made rarer and the space more empty and void,
it follows at once that all the air which lies behind, carries and
pushes it on as it were at its back. For the air which lies
around them always beats 011 things; but at such a time as
this it is able to push on the iron, because on one side a space
is void and receives the iron into it. This air of which I am
speaking to you makes its way with much subtlety through the
frequent pores of the 11011 to its minute parts and then thrusts
and pushes it on, as the wind a ship 31101 its sails. Again all
things must have air in their body, since they 313 of 3 1313 body
and air surrounds and is in contact with all things. This air
therefore which is in the inmost recesses of the iron, is ever
stirred in restless motion and therefore beats the ring without a
doubt and stirs it within, you know: the ring is carried in the
direction in which it 1133 once plunged forward, and into the void
part towards which it has made its start.

Sometimes too it happens that the nature of iron is repelled
from this stone, being in the habit of flying from and following
it in turns. I have seen Samothracian iron rings even jump up,
and at the same time filings of 11011 rave within brass basins,
when this Magnet stone had been placed under: such a strong
desire the iron seems to have to fly from the stone. So great a
disturbance is raised by the interposition of the brass‚ because
sure enough when the current of the brass has first seized on
