in the forests, the fire could not be concealed for any length of
time, but would destroy foresta burn up trees indiscriminately
Do you now see, as we said a little before, that it often makes a
very great difference with what things and in what position the
same first-beginnings are held in union and what motions they
mutually impart and receive, and that the same may when a little
changed in arrangement produce say fires and a fir? just as the
words too consist of elements only a little changed in arrangement,
though we denote firs and {ires with two quite distinct names.
Once again, if you suppose that whatever you perceive among
visible things cannot be produced without imagining bodies of
matter possessed of a like nature, in this way, you will find, the
first-beginnings of things are destroyed: it will come to this that
they will be shaken by loud fits of convulsive laughter and will
bedew with salt tears face and cheeks.

Now mark and learn what remains to be known and hear it
more distinctly. Nor does my mind fail to perceive how dark the

next because on a dark subject I pen such lucid verses o’erlaying
all with the muses’ charm. For that too would seem to be not with-

nauseous wormwood to children, first smear the rim round the
bowl with the sweet yellow juice of honey. that the unthinking
age of children may be fooled as far as the lips, and meanwhile
drink up the bitter draught of wormwood and though beguiled yet
not be betrayed, but rather by such means recover health and
strength3 so I liow, since this doctrine seems generally som'ewhat
