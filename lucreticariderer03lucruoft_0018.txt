wards, unless the waters have first made room? again on what
side can the waters give place, so long as the fish are unable to
go on? Therofore you must either strip all bodies of motion
or admit that in things void is mixed up from which every thing
gcts its first start in moving. Lastly if two broad bodies after
contact quickly spring asunder, the air must surely fill all the
void which is formed between the bodies. Well however rapidly
it stream together with swift—circling 0111161115, yet the whole space
will not be able to be filled up in one moment; for it must occupy
first one spot* and then another, until the whole is taken up. But
if haply any one supposes that, when the bodies have started
asunder, that result follows because the air condenses, he is mis-
taken3 for a void is then formed which was not before, and a void
also is filled which existed before3 nor can the air condense in
such a way, nor supposing it could, could it methinks without
void draw into itself and bring its parts together.

Wherefore however long you hold out by urging many ob-
jections, you must needs in the end admit that there is a void in
things. And many more arguments I may state to you in order
to accumulate proof on my words; but these slight footprints are
enough for a keen-searching mind to enable you by yourself to
find out all the rest. For as dogs often discover by smell the
lair of a mountain-ranging wild beast though covered over with
leaves, when once they have got on the sure tracks, thus you in
cases like this will be able by yourself alone to see one thing after
another and find your way into all dark corners and draw forth
the truth. But if you lag or swerve a jot from the reality, this
Ι can promise you, Memmius, without more ado: such plenteous
draughts from abundant wellsprings my sweet tongue shall pour
from my richly furnished breast‚ that I sear slow age will steal
over our limbs and break open in us the fastnesses of life, ere the
whole store of reasons on any one question has by my verses been
dropped into your ears.

But now to resume the thread of the design which I am weav-
ing in verse: all nature then, as it exists by itself, is founded on
two things: there are bodies and there is void in which these
bodies are, placed and through which they move about. For that
body exists by itself the general feeling of mankind declares; and
unless at the very first belief in this be firmly grounded‚ there
