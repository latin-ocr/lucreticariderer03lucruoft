sets forth that there arc Acherusian quarters, publishing it in
immortal verses 3 though in our passage thither neither our souls
nor bodies hold together, but only certain idols pale in wondrous
wise. From these places he tells us the ghost of everliving Homer
uprose before him and began to shed salt tears and to unfold in
words the nature of things. Wherefore we must well grasp the
principle of things above, the principle by which the courses of the
sun and moon go on, the force by which every thing on earth pro-
ceeds, but above all we must find out by keen reason what the
soul and the nature of the mind consist of, and what thing it is
which meets us when awake and frightens our minds, if we are
under the influence of disease3 meets and frightens us too when
we are buried in sleep ; so that we seem to see and hear speaking
to us face to face them who are dead, whose bones earth holds in
its embrace. Nor does my mind fail to perceive how hard it is to
make clear in Latin verses the dark discoverics of the Greeks,
especially as many points must be dealt with in new terms on
account of the poverty of the language and the novelty of the
questions. But yet your worth and the looked for pleasure of
sweet friendship prompt me to undergo any labour and lead me
on to watch the clear nights through, seeking by what words and

clear a light that you can thoroughly scan hidden things.

This terror then and darkness of mind must be dispelled not
by the rays of the sun and glittering shafts of day, but by the
aspect and the law of nature3 the warp of whose design we shall
begin with this first principle, nothing is ever gotten out of
nothing by divine power. Fear in sooth holds so in check all
mortals, because they see many operations go on in earth and
heaven, the causes of which they can in no way understand,
believing them therefore to be done by power divine. For these
reasons when we shall have seen that nothing can be produced
from nothing, we shall then more correctly ascertain that which
we are seeking, both the elements out of which every thing can be
produced and the manner in which all things are done without the
hand of the gods.

If things came from nothing, any kind might be born of any
thing, nothing would require seed. Men for instance might rise
out of the sea, the scaly race out of the earth, and birds might
