quarters of heaven. The plains sank down, the high hills grew in
elevation3 for the rocks could not settle down nor all the parts
sink to one uniform level.

Thus then the ponderous mass of earth was formed with close-
cohering body and all the slime of the world so to speak slid down
by its weight to the lowest point and settled at the bottom like
dregs. Then the sca, then the air, then the 1116-1601611 611161 113611,
611 616 left unmixed with their clear bodies3 and some are lighter
than others, and clearest and lightest of all ether floats upon the
airy cui-rents, and blends not its clear body with the troubled airs;
it suffers all these things below to be upset with furious hurri-
061163, suffers them to be troubled by wayward storms3 while it
carries along its own fires gliding with a changeless onward sweep.
For that ether may stream on gently and with one uniform effort
the Pontos shews‚ a sea which streams with a changeless current,
ever preserving one uniform gliding course.

Let us now sing what causes the motions of the stars. In the
first place, if the great sphere of heaven revolves, we must say
that 611 611 presses on the pole at each end and confines it on the
outside and 010363 it in at both ends3 and then that a third air
streams above and moves in the same direction in which roll on
as they shine the 31613 of the eternal world ; 01 6136 11161 11113 third
611 3131661113 below in order to carry up the sphere in 1116 contrary
direction3 just 63 we see rivers turn wheels and water-scoops. It
is likewise quite possible 100 that 611 1116 heaven remains at rest,
while at 1116 361116 111116 1116 glittering signs 616 carried 011; either
because rapid heats of ether are shut in and whirl round while
seeking a way out and roll their fires in all directions through
heaven's Summanian quarters3 or else an air streaming from some
part from another source outside drives and whirls the fires3 or
else they may glide on of themselves going whithersoever the food
of each calls and invites them, feeding their flamy bodies every-
where throughout heaven. For which of these 0611363 13 111 opera-
tion 111 11113 world, it is not easy to affirm for certain3 but what

formed on various plans, this Ι 166011, and Ι 80 011 10 361 forth
several causes which may exist throughout the universe for the
motions of stars; one of which however must in this world also be
the cause that imparts lively motion to the signs3 but to dictate
