yet all things with heaven and earth and sea included are nothing
to the whole sum of the universal sum.

And now at last I will explain in what ways yon flame roused
to fury in a moment blazes forth from the 111180 furnaces of Aetna.
And first the nature of the whole mountain is hollow underneath,
underpropped throughout with caverns of basalt rocks. Further-
more in all caves are wind and air; for wind is produced, when
the 'air has been stirred and put in motion. When this air has
been 1311010118111)7 heated and raging about has imparted its heat
to 311 1110 rocks round, wherever it comes in contact with them,
and to the earth, and has struck out from them 1110 11111111118 with
swift flames, it rises up and then forces itself out 011 111811 straight
through the gorges3 and 50 carries its heat far and scatters far its
ashes and 10115 011 511101ῐο of a thick pitchy blackness and flings
out at 13110 531110 111110 5101105 of prodigious weight3 leaving no
doubt that this 15 1110 stormy force of air. Again the 503 10 3
great extent breaks its waves and sucks back 115 surf at 1110 10015
of that mountain. Caverns 103011 from this sea as far 35 1110 deep
gorges of the mountain below. Through these you must admit
[that air mixed up with water passes3 and] the nature of the 0350
compels [this air to enter in from that] open sea and pass right
within and then go out in blasts and so list up flame and throw
0111 5101105 311(1 13150 clouds of sand3 for on the summit 310 cratere,

and mouths.

There are things too not a few for which it is not sufficient to
3551811 0110 031150; you must give several, one of which 31 the same
time 15 1110 1031 cause. For instance should you see the lifeless
body of a man lying at some distance, it would be natural to men-
tion all the different causes of death, in order that the one real
cause of that man's death be mentioned among them. Thus you
may be able to prove that he has not died by steel or cold 01 from
disease or haply from poison 3 yet we know that it is something
of this kind which has befallen him ; and so in many other cases
- we may make the same remark.

The Nile rises every summer and overflows the plains, that
· 0110 5010 river throughout the whole land of Egypt. It waters
Egypt often in the middle of the hot season‚ either because in
summer there are north winds opposite its mouths, which at that
