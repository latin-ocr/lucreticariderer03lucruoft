have a stronger smell when crushed, when pounded, when broken
up by fire, shews that odours stream and withdraw from the inner
parts of things: next you may see that smell is formed of larger
first-beginnings than voice, since it does not pass through stone
walls, through which voice and sound are borne without fail. For
this reason also you will find that it is not so easy to trace out in
what quarter a thing which smells is situated 3 for the blow cools
down as it loiters through the air, and the courier particles of
things are no longer hot when they finish their race to senseg for
which reason dogs are often at fault and lose the scent.

But what I have said is not found in smells and in the class
of flavours only, but also the forms and colours of things are not
all so well suited to the senscs of all, but that some will be more
distressing to the sight than others, Moreover ravenous lions
cannot face and bear to gaze upon a cock with flapping wings
putting night to rout and Wont to summon morning with shrill
voice: in such wise they at once bethink themselves of flight,
because sure enough in the body of cocks are certain seeds, and
these, when they have been discharged into the eyes of lions, bore
into the pupils and cause such sharp pain that courageous though
they be, they cannot continue to face them 3 while at the same
time these things cannot hurt at all our sight, either because
they do not enter in or because the moment they enter a free
passage out of the eyes is granted thern, so that they cannot by
staying behind hurt the eyes in any part.

Now mark, and hear what things move the mind, and learn
in 0 few words whence the things which come into it do corne.
I say first of all that idols of things wander about many in num—
ber in many ways in all directions round, extremely thin3 and
these when they meet, readily unite, like a cobweb or piece of
gold-leaf. For these idols are far thinner in texture than those
which take possession of the eyes and provoke vision; since these
enter in through the porous parts of the body and stir the fine
nature of the mind within and provoke sensation. Therefore we
see Centaurs and limbs of Scyllas and Cerberus-like faces of dogs

and idols of those who are dead, whose bones earth holds in its
embrace3 since idols of every kind are everywhere borne about,
partly those which are spontaneously produced within the air,
partly all those which withdraw from various things and those
