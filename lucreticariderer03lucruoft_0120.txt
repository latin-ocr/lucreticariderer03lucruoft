awe-inspiring and sull os diguity. She is tongue-tied, cannot speak,
then she has a lisp; the dumb is bashful3 then the fire-spit‚ the
teazing, the gossiping turns to a shining lamp. One becomes a
slim darling then when she cannot live from want of flesh; and
she is only spare, who is half-dead with cough. Thcn the fat and
big-breasted is a Ceres' sels big-breasted from Iacchus; the pug-
nosed is a she Silenus and a satyress; the thick-lipped a very kiss.
It were tedious to attempt to report other things of the kind. Let

Nor does the woman sigh always with feigned passion, when
she locks in her embrace and joins with her body the man’s body
and holds it, sucking his lips into her lips and drinking in his
