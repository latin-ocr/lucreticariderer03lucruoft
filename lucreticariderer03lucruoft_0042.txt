sufficient to produce the varied motions by which nature carries on
things. Wheresore again and again I say bodies must swerve a
little; and yet not moro than the least possible ; lest we be found
to be imagining oblique motions and this the reality should refute.
For this we see to be plain and evident, that weights‚ so far as in
them is, cannot travel obliquely‚ when they fall from above, at
least so far as you can peroeive ; but that nothing swerves in any
case from the straight course, who is there that can perceive 2
Again if all motion is ever linkcd together and a new motion
ever springs from another in a fixed order and first-beginnings do
not by swerving make some commenccment of motion to break
through the decrees of fate, that cause follow not cause from ever-
lasting‚ whence have all living creatures here on earth, whence, I
ask, has been wrested from the fates the power by which we go
forward whither the will leads each, by which likewise we change
the direction of our motions neither at afixed time nor fixed place,
but when and where the mind itself has prompted? For beyond
a doubt in these things his own will makes for each a beginning
and from this beginning motions are welled through the limbs.
See you not too, when the barriers are thrown open at a given
moment, that yet the eager powers of the horses cannot start
forward so instantaneously as the mind itself desires? the whole
store of matter through the whole body must be sought out, in
order that stirred up through all the frame it may follow with
undivided effort the bent of the mind; so that you see the begin-
ning of motion is born from the heart, and the action first com-
mences in the will of the mind and next is transmitted through
the whole body and frasne. Quite different is the case when we
move on propelled by a stroke inflictcd by the strong might and
strong compulsion of another3 for then it is quite clear that all the
matter of the whole body moves and is hurried on against our
inclination‚ until the will has reined it in throughout the limbs.
Do you see then in this case that, though an outward force often
pushes men on and compels them frequently to advance against
their will and to be hurried headlong on, there yet is something in
our breast sufficient to struggle against and resist it? And when
too this something chooses, the store of matter is compelled some-
times to change its course through the limbs and frame, and
after it has been forced fni-ward, is reined in and settles back into
