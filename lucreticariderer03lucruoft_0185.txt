be approached by a very circuitous road 3 wherefore all the more I
call for an attentive ear and mind.

In the first place from all things whatsoever which we see
there must incessantly stream and be discharged and scattered
abroad such bodies as strike the eyes and provoke vision. Smells
too incessantly stream from certain things; as does cold from
rivers, heat from the sun, spray from the waves of the sea, that
eater into walls near the shore. Various sounds too cease not to
stream through the air. Thon a moist salt flavour often comes
into the mouth, when we are moving about beside the sea3 and
when we look on at the mixing of a decoction of wormwood,
its bitterness affects us. In such a constant stream from 311 things
1116 several qualities of things are carried and are transmitted in
all directions round, and no delay, no respite in the fiow 15 ever
granted, since we constantly have feeling, and may at any time
see, 5111611 311(1 hear the sound of anything.

And now I will state 01166 again how rare a body all things
have: a question made clear in the first part of my poem also:
although the knowledge of this is of importance in regard to many
things, above all in regard to this very question which I am
coming to discuss, at the very outset it 15 necessary to establish
that nothing 6011165 under sense save body mixed with void. For
instance in caves rocks overhead sweat with moisture and trickle
down in oozing drops. Sweat too oozes out frmn our whole
body, the beard grows, and hairs over all our limbs and frame.
F ood is distributed through all the veins, gives increase and
nourishment to the very extremities and nails. We feel too 601(1
311(1 11631 pass through brass, we feel them pass through gold and
silver, when we hold full cups. Again voices fiy through the stone
partitions of houses; smell passes through and cold, and the heat
of fire which is wont ay to pierce even the strength of iron, where
the Gaulish cuii-ass girds the body round. And when a storm has
gathered in earth and heaven, and when along with it the influ-
ence of disease makes its way in from without, they both withdraw
respectively to heaven and earth and there work their wills, since
there is nothing at all that is not of a rare texture of body.

Furthermorc all bodies whatever which are discharged from
things are not qualified to excite the same sensations nor are
adapted for all things alike. The sun for instance bakes and dries
