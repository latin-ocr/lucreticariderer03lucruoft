vouring scythes have carried off among the horses’ feet his left
arm shield and all; another sees not 11131 1115 right arm has
dropped from him, while he mounts and presses sorward. An-
other tries to get up after he 1135 1051 1115 leg, while the dying foot
quivers with its toes on the ground close by. The head too when
cut off from the warm and living trunk retains on the ground the
expression of life and open eyeS‚ until it has yielded up all the
remnants of soul. To take another case, if, as a serpent's tongue
is quivering‚ as its tail is darting out from its long body, you
choose to chop with an axe into many pieces both [tail and body]‚
you will 566 311 1116 separate portions thus cut off writhing under
the fresh wound and bespattering the earth with gore, the fore
part with the mouth making for its own hinder part, to allay with
burning bite the pain of the wound with which it has been smit-
ten. Shall we say then that there are entire 501115 111 311 111056
pieces? why from that argument 113 will follow that one living
creature had many souls in its body; and this being absurd,
therefore the soul which was one has been divided together with
the body3 therefore each alike must be reckoned mortal, since
each is alike chopped up into many pieceS.

Again if the nature of the soul 15 immortal and makes its
way into our body 31 1116 time of birth, why are we unable 10
remember besides the time already gone, and why do we retain
no traces of past actions? If the power of the mind has been so
completely changed, that all remembrance of past things is lost,
that methinks differs not widely from death 3 therefore you must
admit that the soul which was before has perished and that which
now is has now been formed.

Again if the quickened power of the mind 15 wont 10 be put
into us after our body 15 fully formed, at the instant of our birth
and our crossing the threshold of life, it ought agr-eeably to 11115
10 11116 not in such a way 35 to seem to have grown with the body
and together with its members within the blood, but 35 111 3 den
apart by and to itself: the very contrary to what undoubted fact
teaches3 for it is so closely united with the body throughout 1116
veins flesh sinews and bones, that the very teeth have a share of
sense3 as their aching proves and the sharp twinge of cold water
and the crunching of 3 rough stone, when it has got into them
out of broad. Wherefore, again and again I say, we must believe
