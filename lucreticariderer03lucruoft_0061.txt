dazzling brilliancy: if all these things were now for the first time,
if I say they were now suddenly presented to mortals beyond all
expectation, what could have been named that would be more
marvellous than these things or that nations beforehand would
less venture to believe could be? nothing, methinks: so wondrous
strange had been this sight. Yet how little, you know wearied
as all are to satiety with seeing, any one now cares to look up into
heaven’s glittering quarters! Cease therefore to be dismayed by
the mere novelty and so to reject reason from your mind with
loathing: weigh the questions rather with keen judgment and if
they seem to you to be true, surrender, or if they are a falsehood,
gird yourself to the encounter. For since the sum of space is un-
limited outside beyond these walls of the world, the mind seeks
to apprehend what there is yonder there, to which the spirit ever
yearns to look forward, and to which the mind's immission reaches
in fiee and unembarrassed flight.

In the first place we see that round in all directions, about
above and underneath, throughout the universe there is no bound,
as I have shewn and as the thing of itself proclaims with
loud voice and as clearly shines out in the nature of bottomless
space. In no wise then can it be deemed probable, when space
yawns illimitable towards all points and seeds in number num-
berless and sum unfathomable fly about in manifold ways driven
on in ceaseless motion, that this single earth and heaven have
been brought into being, that those bodies of matter so many in
number do nothing outside them; the more so that this world
has been made by nature, just as the seeds of things have
chanced spontaneously to clash, after being brought together in
manifold wise without purpose, without foresight, without result,
and at last have filtered through such seeds as, suddenly thrown
together, were fitted to become on each occasion the rudimeuts
of great things, of earth sea and heaven and the race of living
things. Wherefore again and again I say you must admit that
there are elsewhere other combinatione of matter like to this
which ether holds in its greedy grasp.

Again when much matter is at hand, when room is there
and there is no thing, no cause to hinder, things sure enough
must go on and be completed. Well then if on the one hand
there is so great a store of seeds as the whole life of living
