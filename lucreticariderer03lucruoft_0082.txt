souls to be neither without a birth nor exempted from the law of
death 3 for we must not believe that they could have been so
completely united with our bodies if they found their way into
them from without, nor, since they are so closely inwoven with

them, does it appear that they can get out unharmed and unloose
themselves unscathed from all the sinews and bones and jointS.
But if haply you believe that the soul finds its way in from
without and is wont to ooze through all our limbs, so much the ο
more it will perish thus blendcd with the body3 for what oozes
through another is dissolved, and therefore dies. As food dis-
tributed through all the cavities of the body, while it is trans-
mitted into the limbs and the whole frame, is destroyed and
furnishes out of itself the matter of another nature, thus the soul
and mind, though they pass entire into a fresh body, yet in oozing
through it are dissolved‚ whilst there are transmitted so to say
into the frame through all the cavities those particles of which
this nature of mind is formed, which now is sovereign in our body,
being born out of that soul which then perished when dispersed
through the frame. Wherefore the nature of the soul is seen to
be neither without a birthday nor exempt from death.

Again are seeds of the soul left in the dead body or not? If
they are left and remain in it, the soul cannot fairly be deemed
immortal, since it has withdrawn lessened by the 1055 of some
parts 3 but if when taken away from the yet untainted limbs it
has fled 50 entirely away 35 to leave in the body no parts of
itself, whence do carcases exude worms from the now rank fiesh
and whence does such a swarm of living things, boneless and
bloodless, surge through the heaving fraine? But if haply you
believe that souls find their way into worms from without and
can severally pass each into a body and you make no account
of why many thousands of souls meet together in a place from
which one has withdrawn, this question at least must, it seems, be
raised and brought to a decisive test, whether souls hunt out
the several seeds of worms and build for themselves a place to
dwell in, or find their way into bodies fully formed so to say.
But why they should on their part make a body or take such
trouble, cannot be explained ; since being without a body they
are not ‘plagued as they flit about with diseases and cold and
hunger, the body being more akin to, more troubled by such
