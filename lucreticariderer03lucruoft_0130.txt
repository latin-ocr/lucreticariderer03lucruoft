122 V 241-279

bers we see to be of a body that had a birth and of forms that
are mortal, we pcrceive to be likcwise without exception mortal,
and at the same time to have had a birth. Since therefore I
sce that the chiefest members and parts of the world are destroy-
ed and bcgotten anew, I may be sure that for heaven and earth
as well there has been a time of beginning and there will be a
time of destruction.

And herein that you may not think Ι have unfairly seized
on this point for myself, because I have assumed that earth and
lire are mortal and have not doubted that water and air perish,
and have said that these are likewise begotten and grow afresh,
mark the proofs: first of all some portion of the earth, burnt up
by constant, suns, trampled by a multitude of feet, sends forth a
cloud and flying eddies of dust, which the strong winds disperse
over the whole air. Part too of the soil is put under water by
mins, and rivers graze against and eat into the banks. Agaiu
whatever increases something else, is in its turn replenished; and
since beyond a doubt earth the universal mother is found at the
same time to be the general tomb of things, therefore you see she
is lessened and increases and grows again.

F urthermore, that sea rivers fount-ains always stream over
with new moisture and that waters well up without ceasing, it
needs no words to prove: the great flow of waters from all sides
clearly shews it. But then the water on the surface is always
taken off, and thus it is that on the whole there is no overflow‚
partly because the seas are lessened by the strong winds sweep—
ing over them and by the ethereal sun decomposing them with
his rays3 partly, because the water is diffused below the surface
over all lands3 for the salt is strained off and the matter of liquid
streams back again to the source and all meets together at the
river·heads‚ and then flows over the lands in a fresh current,
where a channel once scooped out has carried down the waters
with liquid foot.

And next I will speak of the air which is changed over its
whole body every hour in countless ways. For whatever ebbs
from things, is all borne always into the great sea of air3 and
unless it in return were to give back bodies to things and to re-
oruit them as they ebb, all things ere now would have been dis-
solved and changed into air. It therefore ceases not to be begotten
