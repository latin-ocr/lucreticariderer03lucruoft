to assign colours to the first-beginnings of things, falls to the
ground, since white things are not produced from white, nor
those which are black from black, but out of things of various
colours. For white things will much more readily rise up and be
born from no 0010111 than from a black or any other colour which
thwarts and opposes it.

Moreover since colours cannot exist without light and first-
beginnings of things do not come out into the light, you may
be sure they are clothed with no colour. For what colour can
there be in total darkness? nay it changes in the light itself
- according as its brightness comes from a straight or slanting
stroke of light. After this fashion the down which cncircles and
crowns the nape and throat of doves shews itself in the sun: at
0110 111110 11 15 ruddy with the hue of bright pyropus3 at another
it appears by a certain way of looking at it to blend with coral-
red green emeralds. The 1011 of the peacock when it is saturated
with abundant light, changes in like fashion its colours as it
turns about. And since these colours are begotten by a certain
stroke of light, sure enough you must believe 11101 they cannot
be produced without it. And since the pupil receives into it
0 kind of blow, when it is said to perceive a white 0010111, and
then another, when it perceives black or any other 0010111, and
since it is of no moment with what colour the things which you
touch are provided, but rather with what sort of shape they are
furnished‚ you are to know that first-beginnings have no need of
colours, but give forth sensations of touch varying according to
their various shapes.

Moreover since no particular kind of 0010111 15 assigned to par-
ticular shapes and every configuration of first-beginnings can exist
in any colour, why 011 0 like principle are not the things which
are formed out of them in every kind o'erlaid with colours of
every kind? For then it were natural that crows too in flying
should often display 0 white 0010111 from white wings and that
swans should come to be black from 0 black seed, or of any other
different colour you please.

Again the more minute the parts are into which anything is
rent, the more you may perceive the colour fade away by little
and little and become extinct3 as for instance if a piece of purple
