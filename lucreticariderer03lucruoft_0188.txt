and taken possession of the open passages of the iron, the cur-
rent of the stone comes after and finds all things full in the iron
and has no opening to swim through as before. It is forced there-
fore to dash against and beat with its wave the iron texture; by
which means it repels from it and sets in motion through the
brass that which without the brass it often ‹lraws to itself. And
forbear hercin to wonder that the current from this stone is not
able to set in motion other things as well as iron: some of these
stand still by the power of their own weight3 for instance gold3
and others, because they are of so rare a body that the current
flics through them uninterrupted, cannot in any case be set in
motion3 to which class wood is found to belong. When therefore
the nature of iron lying between the two has received into it cer-
tain first·b0dies of brass, then do the Magnet stones set it in
motion with their stream.

And yet these cases are not so much at variance with other
things, that I have only a scanty store of similar instances to
relate of things mutually fitted one for the other and for nothing
else: stones for instance you see are cemented by mortar alone;
wood is united with wood so firmly by bulls’ glue only, that the
veins of boards often gape in cracks before the binding power
of the glue can be brought to loosen its hold. Vine-born juices
venture to mix with streams of water, though heavy pitch and
light oil cannot. Again the purple dye of the shellfish so unites
with the body of wool alone, that it cannot in any case be severed,
not were you to take pains to undo what is done with N eptune's
wave, not if the whole sea were willed to wash it out with all its
waters. Then too is there not one thing only that fastens gold to
gold, and is not brass soldered to brass by tin? and how many
other cases of the kind might one find! what then ἲ you have no
need whatever of such long circuitous roads, nor is it worth my
while to spend so much pains on this, but it is better briefly to
comprise many things in few words: things whose textures have
such a mutual correspondence, that cavities fit solids, the cavities
of the first the solids of the second, the cavities of the second
the solids of the first, form the closest union. Again some things
may be fastened together and held in union with hooks and eyes

as it were; and this seems rather to be the case with this stone
and iron.
