by their journey and wcakened by passing through much air: or
else because the same force which has carried on his orb above
the earth, compels him to change his course and pass below the
earth.

At a fixod time too Matuta spreads rosy morning over the
borders of ether and opens up her light, either because the same
sun, coming back below the earth, seizes heaven before his time
trying to kindle it with his rays3 or because fires meet together
and many seeds of heat are accustomed to stream together at a
fixed time, which cause new sunlight to be born every day.
Thus they tell that from the high mountains of Ida scattered
fires are seen at day-break, that these then unite as it were into
a single ball and make up an orb. And herein it ought to cause
no surprise that these seeds of fire stream together at a time so
surely fixed and reproduce the radiance of the sun. For we see
many occurrences which take place at a fixed time in all things.
At a fixed time trees blossom and at a fixed time shed their
blossoms3 and at a time no less surely fixed age bids the teeth
be shed and the boy put on the soft dress of puberty and let a
soft beard fall down equally from each cheek. Lastly lightnings
snow rains clouds and winds take place at not very irregular sea-
sons of year. For where causes from their very first beginnings .
have been in this way and things have thus fallen out from the
first birth of the world, in due sequence too they now come round
after a fixed order.

Likewise days may lengthen and nights wane, and days shorten
when the nights receive increase, either because the same sun
running his course below the earth and above in curves of unlike
length parts the bordei-s of ether and divides his orbit into un-
equal halves3 and 115 115 comes round adds on in the opposite half
just as much as he has subtracted from the other of the two
halv 55, until he has arrived at that sign of heaven, where the node
of the year makes the shades of night of the same length as the
daylight. For when the sun's course lies midway between the
blast of the north and of the south, heaven keeps his two goals
apart at distances now rendered exactly equal on account of the
position of the whole starry circle, in gliding through which the
sun takes up the period of a year, lighting with slanting rays
earth and heavenÍ¾ as is clearly shewn by the plans of those who
