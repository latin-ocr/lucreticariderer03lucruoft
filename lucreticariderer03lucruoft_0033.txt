arrangements such as those out of which this our suin of things
has been formed, and by which too it is preserved through many
great years when once it has been thrown into the appropriate
motions, and causes the streams to replenish the greedy sea with

copious river waters and the earth, fostered by the heat of the sun, ““

’ to renew its produce, and the race of living things to come up and
flourish, and the gliding fires of ether to live: all which these
several things could in no wise bring to pass, unless a store of
matter could rise up from infinite space, out of which store they

N.

are wont to make up in due season whatever has bcen lost'fR

For as the nature of living things when robbed of food loses its
substance and wastes away, thus all things must be broken up, as
soon as matter has ceased to be supplied, diverted in any way
from its proper course. Nor can blows from without hold together
all the sum which has been brought into union. They can it is
true frequently strike upon and stay a part, until others come and
the sum can bc coinpleted. At times however they are compelled
to rebound and in so doing grant to the first-beginnings of things
room and time for fiight, to enable them to get clear away from
the mass in union. Wherefore again and again Ι repeat many
bodies must rise upg nay for the blows themselves not to fail,
there is need of an infinite supply of matter on all sides.

And herein, Memmius, be far from believing thiS, that all
things as they say press to the centre of the sum, and that for
this reason the nature of the world stands fast without any strokes
from the outside and the uppermost and lowest parts cannot part
asunder in any direction, because all things have been always
pressing towards the centre (if you can believe that anything can
rest upon itself); or that the heavy bodies which are beneath the
earth all press upwards and are at rest on the earth, turned topsy-
turvy, just like the images of things we see before us in the waters.
In the same way they niaintain that living things walk head
downwards and cannot tumble out of earth into the parts of
heaven lying below them any more than our bodies can spon-
taneously fiy into the quarters of heaven3 that when those see
the sun, we behold the stars of night; and that they share with us
time about the seasons of heaven and pass nights equal in length
to our days. But'groundless [error has devised such dreanis]
