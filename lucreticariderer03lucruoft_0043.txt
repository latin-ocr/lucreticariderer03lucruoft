its place. Wherefore in seeds too you must admit the same,
admit that besides blows and weights there is another cause of
motions, from which this power of free action has been begotten
in us, since we 500 that nothing can come from nothing. For
weight forbids that all things be done by blows through as it
were an outward force; but that the mind itself does not feel
an internal necessity in all its actions and is not as it were over-
mastered and compelled to bear and put up with this, is caused
by a minute swerving of first-beginnings at no fixed part of space
and no fixed time.

Nor was the store of matter ever more closely massed nor held
apart by larger spaces between3 for nothing is either added to
its bulk or lost to it. Wherefore the bodies of the first-begin-
nings in time gone by moved in the same way in which now
they move, and will ever hereafter be borne along in like manner,
and the things which have been wont to be begotten will be be-
gotten after the same law and will be and will grow and will wax
in strength so far as is given to each by the decrees of nature.
And no force can change the sum of things3 for there is nothing
outside, either into which any kind of matter can escape out of
the universe or out of which a new supply can arise and burst
into the universe and change all the nature of things and alter
their motions.

And herein you need not wonder at this, that though the
first-beginnings of things are all in motion, yet the sum is seen
to rest in supreme repose‚ unless where a thing exhibits motions
with its individual body. For all the nature of first things lies
far away from our senses beneath their ken3 and therefore sincc
they are themselves beyond what you can see, they must withdraw
from sight their motion as well 3 and the more so that the things
which we can see, do yet often conceal their motions when a great
distance off. Thus often the woolly flocks as they crop the glad
pastures on a hill, creep on whither the grass jewellcd with fresh
dew summons and invites each, and the lambs fed to the full
gambol and playfully butt ; all which objects appear to us from
a distance to be blended together and to rest like a white spot
011 a greenhill. Again when mighty legions fill with their move-
ments all parts of the plains waging the mimicry of war, the
glitter then lifts 1135011Ι up to the sky and the whole earth round
