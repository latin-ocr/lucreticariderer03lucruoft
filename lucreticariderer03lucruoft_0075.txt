404-445 ΙΠ 67

severed from the limbs the trunk yet lives and inhales the
ethereal airs of life. When robbed, if not of the whole, yet of a
large portion of the soul‚ it still lingers in and cleaves to life3 just
as, after the eye has been lacerated all round if the pupil has
continued uninjured, the living power of sight remains, provided
always you do not destroy the whole ball of the eye and pare close
round the pupil and leave only it; for that will not be done even
to the ball without the entire destruction of the eye. But if that
middle portion of the eye, small as it is, is eaten into, the sight is
gone at once and darkness ensues, though a man have the bright
ball quite unimpaired. On such ternis of union soul and mind are
ever bound to each other.

Now mark me: that you may know that the minds and
light souls of living creatures have birth and are mortal, I will
go on to set forth verses worthy of your attention, got together
by long study and invented with welcome effort. Do you mind
to link to one name both of them alike‚ and when for instance
Ι shall choose to speak of the soul‚ shewing it to be mortal,
believe that I speak of the mind as well, inasmuch as both
make up one thing and are one united substance. First of all
then since I have shewn the soul to be fine and to be formed of
minute bodies and made up of much smaller first-beginnings
than is the liquid of water or mist or smoke2—for it far sur-
passes these in nimbleness and is moved, when struck by a far
slenderer cause3 inasmuch as it is moved by images of smoke
and mist3 as when for instance sunk in sleep we see altars steam
forth their heat and send up their smoke on high3 for beyond
a doubt images are begotten for us from these things 2—well
then since you see on the vessels being shattered the water flow
away on all sides, and since mist and smoke pass away into air,
believe that the soul too is shed abroad and perishes much more
quickly and dissolves sooner into its first bodies, when once it
has been taken out of the limbs of a man and has withdrawn.
For, when the body that serves for its vessel cannot hold it,
if shattered from any cause and rarefied by the withdrawal of
blood from the veins, how can you believe that this soul can
be held by any air? how can that air which is rarer than our
body hold it in?

Again we perceive that the mind is begotten along with
