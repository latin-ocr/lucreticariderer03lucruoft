158 VI 228—270

The mighty thunderbolt passes through the walls of houses, like a
shout and voices, pas-ses through stones, through brass, and in
a moment of time melts brass and gold; and causes wine too in an
instant to disappear, while the vessels are untouched, because sure
enough its heat on reaching it readily loosens and rarefies all the
earthen material of the vesscl on every Side and forcing a way
within lightly separates and disperses the first-beginnings of the
wine. This the sun’s heat would be unable to accomplish in an
age, though beating on it incessantly with its quivering heat: so
much more nimble and overpowering is this other force.

And now in what way these are begotten and are formed with
a force so resistless as to be able with their stroke to burst asunder
towers, throw down 11011555, wrench away beams and raftem, and
cast down and burn up the monuments of men, to strike men
dead, prostrate cattle far and near, by what force they can do all
this and the like, I will make clear and will not longer detain you
with mere professions.

Thunderbolts we must suppose to be begotten out of dense
clouds piled up high3 for they are never 55111 forth at all when the
sky is clear or when the clouds are of a slight density. That this
15 so beyond all question is proved by facts evident to sense:
clouds at such times form 50 dense a mass over the whole sky that
we might imagine 511 115 darkness had abandoned Acheron through-
out and filled up the great vaults of heaven: in such numbers,
gathering up out of the frightful night of stoma-clouds, do faces of
black horror hang over us on high, what time the storm begins to
forge its thunderbolts. Very often again a black storm-cloud too
out at sea, like a stream of pitch sent down from heaven, falls in
such wise upon the waters heavily charged with darkness afar off
and draws down a black tempest big with lightnings and storms,
itself so fraught above all the rest with 11155 and winds, that even
on land men shudder and seek shelter. Thus then we must sup-
pose that the storm above our head reaches high up; for the
clouds would never bury the earth in such thick darkness, unless
they were built up high heap upon heap, the sunlight totally dis-
appearing3 nor could the clouds when they descend drown it with
50 great a rain, as to make rivers overflow and put fields under
water, if they were not piled high up in the sky. In this case
then all things are filled with winds and fire3 therefore thunder-
