by divers peoples and races of wild beasts. Then a puddle of
water not more than a finger—breadth deep, which stands between
the stoncs in the streets, offers a prospect beneath the earth of a
reach as vast, as that with which the high yawning maw of heaven
opens out above the earth3 so that you seem to diseern clouds and
see the bodies of birds far withdrawn into that wondrous sky
beneath the earth. A gain when our stout horse has stuck in the
middle of a river and we have looked down on 1110 swift waters of
the stream, some force seems to carry athwart the current the
body of the horse which is standing still and to force it rapidly
up the stream3 and to whatever point we cast our eyes about, all
things seem -to be carried on and 10 100 flowing in the same way as
we are. Again although a portico runs in parallel lines from 000
end to the other and stands supported by equal columns along its
whole extent, yet when from the top of it it is seen in its entire
length, it gradually forms the conti-acted top of a narrowing cone,
until uniting roof with fioor and all the right side with the left it

ΤΟ sailors on the sea the sun appears to rise out of the waters and
10 1110 waters to set and bury his light3 just because they behold
nothing but water and sky3 that you may not lightly suppose the
credit of the senses 10 be shaken on all hands. Then to people
unacquainted with the sea ships in harbour seem to be all askew
and with poop-fittings broken to be pressing up against the water.
For whatever part of the oars is raised above the salt water,
is straight, and the rudders in their upper half are straight: the
parts which are sunk below the water-level, appear to be broken
and bent round and to slope up and turn back towards the sur-
face and 10 100 so much twisted back as wellnigh to float on the
top of the water. And when the winds carry the thinly scattered
clouds across heaven in the night—time, then do the glittering
signs appear 10 glide athwart the rack and to be travelling 00 high
10 a direction quite different to their real course. Then if our
hand chance to be placed beneath one eye and press it below,
through a certain sensation all things which we look at appear
then to become double as we look3 the light of lamps brilliant
with flames to be double, double too the furniture through the
whole house, double men's faces and men’s bodies. Again when
sleep has chained down our limbs in sweet slumber and the whole
