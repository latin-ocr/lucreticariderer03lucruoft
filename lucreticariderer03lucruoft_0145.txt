of all things which you see breathing the breath of life, either
craft or courage or else speed has from the beginning of its ex-
istence protected and preserved each particular race. And there
are many things which, recommended to us by their useful ser-
vices, continue to exist consigned to our protection. In the first
place th'e fierce breed of lions and the savage races their courage
has protected, foxes their craft and stags their proneness to fiight.
But light-sleeping dogs with faithful heart in breast and every
kind which is born of the seed of beasts of burden and at the
same time the woolly flocks and the horned herds are all con-
signed, Memmius, to the protect—ion of man. For they have ever
fied with eagerness from wild beasts and have ensued peace and
plenty of food obtained without their own labour, as we give it
in requital of their useful services. But those to whom nature
has granted none of these qualities, so that they could neither live
by their own means nor perform for us any useful service in
return for which we should suffer their kind to feed and be
safe under our protection, those, you are to know, would lie
exposed as a prey and booty of others, hampered all in their own
death-bringing shackles, until nature brought that kind to utter
destruction.

But Centaurs never have existed, and at no time can there
exist things of twofold nature and double body formed into one
frame out of limbs of alien kinds, such that the faculties and
powers of this and that portion cannot be sufficiently like. This
however dull of understanding you may learn from what follows.
To begin, a horse when three years have gone round is in the
prime of his vigour, far different the boy: often even at that age
he will call in his sleep for the milk of the breast. Afterwards
when in advanced age his lusty strength and limbs now faint with
ebbing life fail the horse, then and not till then youth in the
flower of age commences for that boy and clothes his cheeks in
soft down3 that you may not haply believe that out of a man
and the burden-carrying seed of horses Centaurs can be formed
and have being3 or that Scyllas with bodies half those of fishes
girdled round with raving dogs can exist, and all other things
of the kind, whose limbs we see cannot harmonize together; as
they neither come to their flower at the same time nor reach the
fulness of their bodily strength nor lose it in advanced old age,
