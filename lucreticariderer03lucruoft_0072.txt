frame, and one must ever be more out of view or more prominent
than another, that a single substance may be seen to be formed
from the union of all, lest the heat and spirit apart by themselves
and the power of the air apart by itself should destroy sense and
dissipate it by their disunion. Thus the mind possessos that heat
which it displays when it boils up in anger and fire flashes from
the keen eyes3 there is too much cold spirit comrade of fear,
which spreads a shivering over the limbs and stirs the whole
frame3 yes and there is also that condition of still air which has
place when the breast is calm and the looks cheerful. But they
have more 01 the hot whose keen heart and passionate mind lightly
boil up in anger. Foremost in this class comes the fierce vio-
lence of lions who often as they chafe break their hearts with their
roaring and cannot cont-ain within their breast the billows of their
rage. Then the chilly mind 01 stags is fuller of the spirit and
more quickly rouses through all the flesh its icy currents which
cause a shivering motion to pass over the limbs. But the nature
of oxen has its 1116 rather from the still air, and never does the
smoky torch of anger applied to it stimulate it too much, shedding
over it the shadow 01 murky gloom‚ nor is it transfixed and stif-
fened by the icy shafts of fear: it lies between the other two, stags
and 611161 110115. (And thus it is with mankind: however much
teaching renders some equally refined, it yet leaves behind those
earliest traces of the nature of each mind ; and we are not to sup·
pose that evil habits can be 50 thoroughly plucked up by the roots,
that one man shall not be more prone than another to ‘keen anger,
a second shall not be somewhat more quickly assailed by sear,
a third shall not take some things more meekly than is right. In
many other points there must be differences between the varied
natures of men and the tempers which follow upon these3 though
at present I am unable to set forth the hidden causes of these
or to find names enough 101 the different shapes which belong
to the first-beginnings‚ from which shapes arises this diversity of
thingS. What herein I think I may affirm is this: traces of the
different natures left behind, which reason is unable to expe] from
us, are so exceedingly slight that there 15 nothing to hinder us
from living a life worthy of gods,

Well this nature is contained by the whole body and is in turn
the body's guardian and the cause of its existence; for the two
