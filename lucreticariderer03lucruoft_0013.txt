burst out of the sky3 horned and other herds, every kind of wild
beasts would haunt with changing brood tilth and wilderness alike.
Nor would the same fruits keep constant to trees, but would
change3 any tree might bear any fruit. For if there were not be-
getting bodies for each, how could things have a fixed unvarying
mother? But in fact because things are all produced from fixed
seeds, each thing is born and goes forth into the bol-ders of light
out of that in which resides its matter and first bodies 3 and for
this reason all things cannot be gotten out of all things, because
in particular things resides a distinct power. Again why do we
see the rose put forth in spring, corn in the season of heat, vines
yielding at the call of autumn, if not because, when the fixed
seeds of things have streamed together at the proper time, what-
ever is born discloses itself, while the due seasons are thereand
the quickened earth brings its weakly products in safety forth into
the boi-ders of light? But if they came from nothing, they would
rise up suddenly at uncertain periods and unsuitable times of year,
inasmuch as there would be no first-beginnings to be kept from a
begetting union by the unpropitious season. No nor would time
be required for the growth of things after the meeting of the seed,
if they could increase out of nothing. Little babies would at once
grow into men and trees in a moment would rise and spring out
of the ground. But none of these events it is plain ever comes to
pass, since all things grow step by step [at a fixed time], as is na-
tural, [since they all grow] from a fixed seed ‘and in growing pre·
serve their kind3 so that you may be sure that all things increase
in size and are fed out of their own matter. F urthermore without
fixed seasons of rain the earth is unable to put forth its gladdening
produce, nor again if kept from food could the nature of living
things continue its kind and sustain life3 so that you may hold
with greater truth that many bodies are common to many things,
as we see letters common to different words, than that any thing
could come into being without first-beginnings. Again why could
not nature have produced men of such a size and strength as to be
able to wade on foot across the sea and rend great mountains with
their hands and outlive many generations of living men, if not
because an unchanging matter has been assigned for begetting
things and what can arise out of this matter is fixed? lVe must
admit therefore that nothing can come from nothing, since things
