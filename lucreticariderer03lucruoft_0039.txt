let in and pour the sunlight through the dark chambers of houses:
you will see many minute bodies in many ways through the apparent
void mingle in the midst of the light of the rays, and as in never-
ending conflict skirmish and give battle combating in troops and
never hasting, driven about in frequent meetings and partings3 so
that you may guess from this, what it is for first-beginnings of
things to be ever tossing about in the great void. So far as it
goes, a small thing may give an illustration of great things and
put you on the track of knowledge. And for this reason too it is
meet that you should give greater heed to these bodies which are
seen to tumble about in the sun's rays, because such tumblings
imply that motions also of matter latent and unseen are at the
bottom. For you will observe many things there impelled by un-
seen blows to change their course and driven back to return the
way they came now this way now that way in all directions round.
All you are to know derive this restlessness from the first-begin—
nings. For the first-beginnings of things move first of themselves;
next those bodies which form a small aggregate and come nearest
so to say to the powers of the first-beginnings‚ are impelled and
set in movement by the unseen strokes of those first bodies, and
they next in turn stir up bodies which are a little larger. Thus
motion mounts up from the first-beginnings and step by step issues
forth to our senses, so that those bodies also move, which we can
(liscern in the sunlight‚ though it is not clearly seen by what blows
they so act.

Now what velocity is given to bodies of matter, you may
apprehend, Memmius, in few words from this: when morning first
sprinkles the earth with fresh light and the different birds flitting
about the pathless woods through the buxom air fill all places with
their clear notes, we see it to be plain and evident to all how
suddenly the sun after rising is wont at such a time to overspread
all things and clothe them with his light. But that heat which
the sun emits and that bright light pass not through empty void 3
and therefore they are forced to travel more slowly, until they
cleave through the waves so to speak of air. Nor do the several
minute bodies of heat pass on one by one, but closely entangled
and massed together; whereby at one and the same time they are
pulled back by one another and are impeded from without, so that
they are forced to travel more slowly, But the first—beginnings
