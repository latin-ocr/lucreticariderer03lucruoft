and crossbeams3 for then they dye the seated assemblage below
and all the show of the stage and the richly attired company of
the fathers, and compel them to dance about in their colour.
And the more these objects are shut in all round by the walls
of the theatre, the more do all of them within laugh on all hands,
o'erlaid with graceful hues, the light of day being narrowed.
Thereforo since sheets of canvass emit colour from their surface‚
all things will naturally emit thin pictures too, since in each case
alike they discharge from the surface. There are therefore as now
shewn sure outlines of shapes, which fly all about possessed of an
exquisitely small thickness and cannot when separate be seen one
at a time. ” Again all 5111011 511101ςο heat and other such-like things
stream off things in a state of diffusion, because while they are
coming from the depths of the body having arisen within it, they
are torn 111 their winding passage, and there are 110 straight ori·
fices to the paths, for them to make their way out by in a mass.
But on the other hand when a thiu film of surface colour is
discharged, there is nothing to rend it, since it is ready to hand
stationed in front rank. Lastly in the case of all idols which
shcw themselves to us iu mirrors, in water or any other shining
object, since their outsides are possessed of an appearance like
to the things they represent, they must be formed of emitted
images of things. There are therefore thin shapes and pictures
like to the things, which, though 110 0110 can see them one at
a time, yet when thrown off by constant and repeated reflexion
give back a visible image from the surface of mirrors; and in no
other way it would seem can they be kept so entire that shapes
are given back so exceedingly like each object.

Now mark, and learn how thin the nature of an image is.
And first of all, since the first-beginnings are so far below the
ken of our senses and much 5111111101- than the things which our
eyes first begin to be unable to see, to strengthen yet more the
proof of this also, learn in a few words how minutely fine are
the beginnings of all things. First, living things are in some
cases so very little, that their third part cannot be seen at all.
Of what size are we to suppose any gut of such creatures to be?
or the ball of the heart or the eyes? the limbs? or any part
of the frame? how small they must be! And then further the
several -first-beginnings of which their soul and the nature of
