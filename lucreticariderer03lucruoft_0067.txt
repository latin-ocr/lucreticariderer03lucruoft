wise from the same fear envy causes them to pine: they make
moan that before their very eyes he is powersul, he attracts
attention, who walks arrayed in gorgeous dignity‚ while they
are wallowing in darkness and dirt. Some wear themselves to
death for the sake of statues and a name. And often to such
a degree through dread of death does hate of life and of the
sight of daylight seize upon mortals‚ that they commit sels-
murder with a sorrowing heart, quite forgetting that this fear
is the source of their cares, [this sear which urges men to every
sin], prompts this one to put all shame to rout, another to burst
asunder the bonds of friendship, and in fine to overturn duty
from its very base3 since often ere now men have betrayed
country and dear parents in seeking to shun the Acherusian
quarters. For even as children are flurried and dread all things
in the thick darkness, thus we in the daylight fear at times
things not a whit more to be dreaded than what children shud-
der at in the dark and fancy sure to be. This terror therefore
and darkness of mind must be dispelled not by the rays of the
sun and glittering· shafts of day, but by the aspect and law of

F irst then I say that the mind which we often call the un-
derstanding, in which dwells the directing and governing prin-

eyes are parts of the whole living creature. [Some however
affirm] that the sense of the mind does not dwell in a distinct
part, but is a certain vital state of the body, which the Greeks
call harmonia, because by it, they say, we live with sense, though
the understanding is in no one part; just as when good health
is said to belong to the body, though yet it is not any one part
of the man in health. In this way they do not assign a distinct
part to the sense of the mind; in all which they appear to me
to be grievously at fault in more ways than one. Ostentimes the
body which is visible to sight, is sick, while yet we have pleasure
in another hidden part, and oftentimes the case is the very re-
verse, the man who is unhappy in mind feeling pleasure in his
whole body3 just as if, while a sick man's foot is pained, the head
meanwhile should be in no pain at all. Moreover when the limbs
are consigned to soft sleep and the burdened body lies diffused
without sense, there is yet a something else in us which during
