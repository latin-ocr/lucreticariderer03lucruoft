120 V 157-197

and therefore it is meet to praise the work of the gods calling as it
does for all praise, and to believe that it will be eternal and
immortal, and that it is an unholy thing ever to shake by any
force from its fixed scats that which by the sorethought of the
gods in ancient days has been established on everlasting founda-
tions for mankind, or to assail it by speech and utterly overturn it
from top to bottom3 and to invent and add other figments of
the kind, Memmius, is all sheer folly. For what advantage can
our gratitude bestow on immortal and blessed beings, that for our
sakes they should take in hand to administer aught? And what
novel incident should have induced them hitherto at rest so long
after to desire to change their former life 2 for it seems natural he
should rejoice in a new state of things, whom old things annoy;
but for him* whom no ill has befallen in times gone by, when h'e
passed a pleasant existence, what could have kindled in such
a one a love of change? Did life lie grovelling in darkness and
sorrow, until the first dawn of the birthtime of things? or what
evil had it been for us never to have been born? whoever has
been born must want to continue in life, so long as fond pleasure
shall keep him3 but for him who has never tasted the love, never
been on the lists, of life, what harm not to have been born?

are, so that they knew and saw in mind what they wanted to
make? and in what way was the power of first-beginnings ever
ascertained‚ and what they could effect by a change in their
mutual arrangements, unless nature herself gave the model for
making things? For in suchwise the first-beginnings of things
many in number in many ways impelled by blows for infinite
ages back and kept in motion by their own weights have been
wont to be carried along and to unite in all manner of ways and
thoroughly test every kind of production possible by their mutual
combinations, that it is not strange if they have also fallen
into arrangements and have come into courses like to those
out of which this sum of things is now carried on by constant
renewing.

But if I did not know what first—beginnings of things are,
yet this judging by the very arrangements of heaven I would
venture to affirm, and led by many other facts to maintain, that
