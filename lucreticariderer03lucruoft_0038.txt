the bodies which quit each thing, lessen the things from which
they go, gift with increase those to which they have come, compel
the former to grow old, the latter to come to their prime, and yet
abide not with these. Thus thc sum of things is ever rencwed and
inortals live by a reciprocal dependency. Some nations wax, others
wane, and in a brief space the races of living things are changed
and like runners hand over the lamp of lifc.

If you think that first-beginnings of things can lag and by
lagging give birth to new motions of things, you wander far astray
from the path of true reason: since they travel about through
void, the first-beginnings of things must all move on either by
their own weight or haply by the stroke of another. For when
during motion they have, as often happens, met and clashed, the
result is a sudden rebounding in an opposite direction5 and no
wonder, since they are most hard and of wcight proportioned
to their solidity and nothing behind gets in their way. And that
you may more clearly see that all bodies of matter are in restless
movement, remember that there is no lowest point in the sum of
the universe, and that first bodies have not where to take their
stand, since space is without end and limit and extends immea-
surably in all directions round, as Ῑ have shewn in many words
and as has been proved by sure reason. Since this then is a
certain truth, sure enough no rest is given to first bodies through-
out the unfathomable void, but driven on rather in ceaseless and
varied motion tlssy partly, after they have pressed together,
rebound leaving great spaces between, while in part they are so
dashed away after the stroke as to leave but small spaces between.
And all that form a denser aggregation when brought together
and rebound leaving trifling spaces between, held fast by their
own close—tangled shapes, these form enduring bases of stone and
unyielding bodies of iron and the rest of their class, few in num-
ber, which trave] onward along the great void. All the others
spring far off and rebound far leaving great spaces between: these
furnish us with thin air and bright sunlight. And many more
travel along the great void, which have been thrown off from the
unions of things or though admitted have yet in no case been able
likewise to assimilate their motions. Of this truth, which I am
telling, we have a representation and picture always going on
before our eyes and present to us: observe whenever the rays are
