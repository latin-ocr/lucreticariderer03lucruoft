of things. The first question is why, when the wish has occurred
tn any one to think of a thing, his mind on the instant thinks
of that very thing. Do idols observe our will, and so soon as we
will does an image present itself to 115, if sea, if earth, ay or heaven
is what we wish? Asseinblies of men, a procession‚ feasts, battles,
everything in short does nature at command produce and pro-
vide? and though to increase the marvel the mind of others in
the same spot and room is thinking of things all quite different.
What> again are we to say, when we see in sleep idols advance
in measured tread and move their pliant limbs, when in nimble
wise they put out each pliant arm in turn and represent to the
eyes over and over again an action with foot that moves in time 2
Idols to wit rare imbued with art and move about well-trained,
to be able in the night-time to exhibit such plays. Or will this
rather be the truth? because in one unit of time, when we can
perceive it by sense and while one single word is uttered, many
latent times are contained which reason finds to exist, therefore
in any time you please all the several idols are at hand ready
prepared in each several place. And because they are so thin,
the mind can see distinctly only those which it sti-ains itself to
see3 therefore all that there are besides are lost, save only those
for which it has made itself ready. Moreover it makes itself
ready and hopes to see that which follows upon each thing3 there-
fore the result does follow. Do you not see that the eyes also,
when they essay to discern things which are thin and fine, strain
themselves and make themselves ready, and without that we can-
not see distinct-ly? And yet you may observe even in things
which are plain before us, that if you do not attend, it is just as if
the thing were all the time away and far distant. What wonder
then, if the mind loses all other things save those with which it is
itself earnestly occupied? Then too from small indications we
draw the widest inferences and by our own fault entangle our-
selves in the meshes of self-delusion.

Sometimes it happens too that an image of the same kind is
not supplied, but what before was a woman, turns out in our
hands to have changed into a man; or a different face and age
succeed to the first. But sleep and forgetfulness prevent us from
feeling surprise at this.

And herein you should desire with all your might to shun
