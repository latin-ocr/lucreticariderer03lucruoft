the body and grows up together with it and becomes old along
with it. For even as children go about with a tottering and
weakly body, so slender sagacity of mind follows along with it;
then when their life has reached the maturity of confirmed
strength, the judgment too is greater and the power of the mind
more developed. Afterwards when the body has been shattered
by the mastering might of time and the frame has drooped
with its forces dulled, then the intellect halts‚ the tongue dotes,
the mind gives way, all faculties fail and are found wanting at
the same time. It naturally follows then that the whole nature
of the soul is dissolved, like smoke, into the high air; since we
see it is begotten along with the body and grows up along with
it and, as I have shewn, breaks down at the same time worn
out with age.

Moreover we see that even as the body is liable to violent
diseases and severe pain, so 15 the mind to sharp cares and grief
and fear3 it naturally follows therefore that it is its partner in
death as well. Again in diseases of the body the mind often
wanders and goes astray; for it loses its reason and drivels in
its speech and often in a profound lethargy is carried into deep
and never-ending sleep with drooping eyes and head3 out of
which it neither hears the voices nor can recognise the faces of
those who stand round calling it back to life and bedewing with
tears face and cheeks. Therefore you must admit that the
mind too dissolves, since the infection of disease reaches to it;
for pain and disease are both forgers of death: a truth we have
fully learned ere now by the death of many. Again, when the
pungent strength of wine has entered into a man and its spirit
has been infused into and transmitted through his veins, why
is it that a heaviness of the limbs follows along with this, his
legs are hampered as he reels about, his tongue falters, his
mind is besotted, his eyes swim, shouting hiccuping wranglings
are rife, together with all the other usual concomitante, why is
all this, if not because the overpowering violence of the wine
is wont to disorder the soul within the body? But whenever
things can be disordered and hampered, they give token that if
a somewhat more potent cause gained an entrance, they would
perish and be robbed of all further existence. Moreover it often
happens that some one constrained by the violence of disease
