plague-stricken from every side. They would fill all places and
buildings: wherefore all 1116 more the heat would [destroyfthem
and] thus close-packed death would pile them up in heaps.
Many bodies drawn forth by thirst and tumbled out along the
street would lie extended by the fountains of water, the breath
of life cut off from their too great delight in water; and over all
the open places of the people and the streets you might see many
limbs drooping with their half-liseless body, foul with stench and
covered with rags, perish away from filth of body, with nothing
but skin on their bones, now nearly buried in noisome sores and

dirt. All the holy sanctuarios of the gods too death had filled
with liseless bodies, and all the temples of the heavenly powers

. in all parts stood burdened with carcases: all which places the

wardens had thronged with guests. For now no longer the wor-
ship of the gods or their divinities were greatly regarded: so
overmastering was 1116 present affliction. Nor did those rites of
sepulture continue in force in the city, with which that pious folk
had always been wont 10 be buried3 for 1116 whole of it was in dis-
may and confusion, and each man would sorrowfully bury as the
present moment allowed. And the sudden pressure and poverty
prompted to many frightful acts3 thus with a loud uproar they
would place their own kinsfolk upon the funeral piles of others,

and apply torches, quarrelling often with much bloodshed sooner
than abandon the bodies.
