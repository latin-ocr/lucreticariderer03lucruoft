and stroke the proper places, the form too and size of the sun
must be 56611 from this earth in their real dimensions, so that
you may not add anything whatever more or less. And whether
the moon 35 it is borne on illuminatos places with a bort-owed
light, or 6111115 115 own light from its own body, whatever 11131315,
1116 101111 with which it is thus borne on is not at all larger than
the one which it 111-6561115 10 our eyes seems to us to be. For all
things which we see at a great distance through much air, look
slimmed in appearance before their size is diminished. Therefore
since the moon presents a bright aspect and well-defined form, it
must be secn on high by us froin this carth preciscly such as it is
in the outline which defines it, and of the 5126 it actually is.
Lastly in the 6356 01 311 111056 11165 01 611161 which you observe
from this earth,—since in the 6356 of fires which we see here on
earth, so long as their flickering is distinct, so long as ,111611 11631
15 perceived, their 5126 15 56611 sometimes to change to a very
very small extent either way, according to the distance at which
they are‚—you may infer that the 11165 01 611161 may be smaller
than they look in 311 extremely minute degree, or larger by a very
small and insignificant fraction.

This likewise need not excite wonder, how it is that so small
3 body 35 yon sun can emit 50 great 3 light, enough to flood
completely seas and all lands and heaven and 10 steep all things
in its bui-ning 11631. It well may be that a single spring for the
whole world may open up from this spot and gush out in plen-
teous stream and shoot forth light, because elements of heat- meet
together from all sides out of the whole world in such manner
and the mass of them thrown together streams to a point 111 such
manner, that this heat wells forth from a single source. See you
not too what 3 breadth 01 meadow-land a small spring of water
sometimes floods, streaming out over the fields? It is likewise
possible that heat from the sun's flame though not at all great
may infect the whole air with fervent fires, if haply the air is
in a suit-able and susceptible state, so that it can be kindled
when struck by small bodies of heat3 thus we see sometimes
3 general conflagration from 3 single spark catch fields of corn
and stubble. Perhaps too the sun as he shines alost with rosy
lamp 1135 round about him much fire with 116315 that are not
visible‚ and thus the 111-6 may be marked by no radiance, so that
