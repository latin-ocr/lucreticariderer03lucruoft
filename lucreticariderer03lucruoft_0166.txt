tains much moisturc when it has taken the fire into it, it drowns
it at once with a loud noise; just so iron glowing hot from the
fiery furnaces sometimes hisses, when we have plunged it quickly
into cold water. Again if the cloud which receives the fire is
drier‚ it is set on ΗΓΘ in an instant and bui-ns with a loud noise3
just as if a flame should range over the laurel-covered hills through
a whirlwind and burn thern up with its impetuous assault3 and
there is not anything that burns in the crackling flame with a
more startling sound than the Delphic laurel of Phoebus. Then
often too much crashing of 100 and tumbling in of hail make a
noise in the great clouds on high; for when the wind packs them
together into a confined space, the mountains of storm-clouds
congealed and mixed with hail break up.

It ligh'tens too, when the clouds have struck out by their col-
lision many seeds of Η1·6; just as if a stone were to strike another
stone or a piece of iron; for then too light bursts out and fire
scatters about bright sparks. But we hear the thunder with
our ears after the eyes see the flash of lightning, because things
always travel inore slowly to the ears than those which excite
vision travel to the eyes. This you may perceivc from the fol-
lowing instance as well: when you see a man at a distance
cutting with a double-edged axe a large tree, you perceive the
stroke before the blow carries the sound to the ear: thus we see
lightning too before we hear the thunder, which is discharged at
the same time as the ΗΓΘ from the same cause, being born indeed
from the same collision.

Also in the following manner clouds dye places with winged
light and the storin flashes out with a rapid quivering movement.
When the wind has made its way into a cloud and whirling about
in it has, as I have shewn above, made the cloud hollow with a
dense erust, it becomes hot by its own velocity: thus you see
all things thoroughly heated and fired by motion; nay a leaden
bal] 111 whirling through a long course even melts. WVhen there-
fore this wind now on fire has rent the black cloud, it scatters
abso-ad at once seeds of ΗΓΘ pressed out by force so to speak, and
these produce the throbbing flashes of fiame3 then follows a
sound which strikes 011 the ears more slowly than the things
which travel to our eyes strike 011 them. This you are to know
takes place when the clouds are dense and at the same time
