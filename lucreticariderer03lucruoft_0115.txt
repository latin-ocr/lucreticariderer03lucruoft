sages3 and therefore sense retires deep into the frame as the
1110110115 are all altered. And since there is nothing as it were
to lend support, to the frame, the body becomes weak and all the
limbs are faint, the arms and eyelids droop and the hams even in
bed often give way under you and relax their powers. Then
sleep follows on food, because food produces just the same effects
as air, while it is distributed into all the veins 3 and that sleep is
much the heaviest which you take when full or tired, because
then the greatest number of bodies fall into disorder, bruised by
much exertion. On the same principle the soul comes in part to
be forced more deeply into the frame, and there is also a more
copious emission of it abroad, and at the same time it is more
divided and scattered in itself within you.

And generally 10 whatever pursuit a man is closely tied down
and strongly attached, on whatever subject we have previously
much dwelt, the mind having been put to a more than usual
strain in it, during sleep we for the most part fancy that we are
engaged in the same Í¾ lawyers think they plead causes and draw

tongue. So all other pursuits and arts are seen for the most
part during sleep to occupy and mock the ininds of men. And
whenever men have given during many days in succession undi-
vided attention to games, we generally see that after they have
ccased to perceive these with their senses, there yet remain pas-
sages open in the mind through which the same idols of things
may enter. Thus for many days those same objects present them-
selves to the eyes, so that even when awake they 566 dancers
as they think moving their pliant limbs, and receive into the ears
the clear music of the harp and speaking strings, and behold the
same spectators and at the same time the varied decorations of
the stage in all their brilliancy. So great is the influence of zeal
and 11161111311011, 50 great is the influence of the things in which
men have been habitually engaged, and not 111611 only but all
living creatures. Thus you will see stout horses, even when their
bodies are lying down, yet in their sleep sweat and pant without
ceasing and strain their powers to the utmost as if for the prize,
