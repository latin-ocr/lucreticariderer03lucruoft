turn livid, then the feet and shanks die, then next the steps of
chilly death creep withslow pace over the other members. There-
fore since the nature of the 30111 13 rent and passes away and
does not at one time stand forth in its entireness‚ it must
be reckoncd mortal. But if haply you suppose that it can
draw itself in through the whole frame and mass its parts to-
gether and in this way withdraw sense from all the limbs, yet
then that spot into which so great a 31010 01 soul is gathered,
ought to shew itself in possession of a greater amount of sense.
But as this is nowhere found, sure enough as we said before, it
is torn in pieces and scattered abroad, and therefore dies. More-
over if I were pleased for the moment to grant what is false
and admit that the soul might be collected in one mass in the
body of those who leave the light dying piecemeal, even then
you must admit the soul to be mortal3 and it makes no differ-
ence whether it perish dispersed in air, or gathered into one
lump out 01 all its parts lose all feeling, since sense ever more
and more fails the whole inan throughout and less and less of
life remains throughout.

And since the mind is one part of a man which remains
fixed in a particular spot, just as are the ears and eyes and the
other senses which guide and direct life; and just as the hand
or eye or nose when separated from us cannot feel and exist
apart, but in however short a time wastes away in putrefaction‚
thus the mind cannot exist by itself without the body and the
man’s self which as you see serves for the inind’s vessel or any
thing else you choose to imagine which implies a yet closer
11111011 with it, since the body is attached to it by the nearest
ties

Again the quickened powers of body and mind by their
joint partnership enjoy health and life3 for the nature of the
mind cannot by itself alone without the body give forth vital
motions nor can the body again bereft of the soul continue to
exist and make use of its senses: just, you are to know, as the
eye itself torn away from its roots cannot see anything when
apart from the whole body, thus the soul and mind cannot it is
plain do anything by themselves. Sure enough, because mixed
up through veins and flesh, sinews and bones, their first-begin-
nings are confined by all the body and are not free to bound
