over me to think that nature by thy power is laid thus visibly
open, is thus unveiled on evcry side.

And now since I have shcwn what-like the beginnings of all
things arc and how diverse with varied shapes as they fly sponta-
neously driven on in everlasting motion, and how all things can be
severally produced out of these, next after these questions the nature
of the mind and soul should methinks be cleared up by my verses
and that dread of Acheron be driven headlong forth, troubl'mg as
it does the life of man from its inmost depths and overspreading
all things with the blackness of death, allowing no pleasure to be
pure and unalloyed. For as to what men often give out that
diseases and a life of shame are more to be feared than Tartarus
place of death, and that they know the soul to be of blood or
it may be of wind, if haply their choice so direct, and that they
have no need at all of our philosophy, you may perceive for the
following reasons that 311 111050 boasts are thrown out more for
glory's sake than because the thing is really believed. These
very men, exiles from their country and banished far from the

mask is torn off, the reality is left. Avarice again and blind lust
of honours which constrain unhappy men to overstep the bounds
of right and sometimes 35 partners and agents of crimes to strive
night and day with surpassing effort to struggle up to the summit
of power,—these sores of life 310 111 110 small measure fostered by
the dread of death. For foul scorn and pinching want in every
case are seen to be far removed from 3 life of pleasure and se-'
curity and to be a loitering so to say before the gates of death.
And while men driven on by 311 unreal dread wish to escape far
away from these and keep them far from them, they amass wealth
by civil vbloodshed and greedily double their riches piling up
murder on murder3 cruelly triumph in the sad death of a
brother and hate and sear the tables of kinsfolk. Often like-
