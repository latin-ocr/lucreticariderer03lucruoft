shew that there are things [which are possessed of no colour].
Well any colour without any exception changes into any other;
and this first-beginnings ought in no wise to do: something
unchangeable must remain over, that all things be not utterly
reduced to nothing. For whenever a thing changes and quits
its proper limits, at once this change of state is the death of that
which was before. Thercforc mind not to dye with colour the
seeds of things, that you may not have all things altogether
returning to nothing.

Moreover if no quality of colour is assigned to first-beginnings
and they are yet possessed of varied shapes out of which they
beget colours of every kind and change them about by reason
that it makes a great difference with what other seeds and in
what position the seeds are severally held in union and what
motions they mutually impart and receive, you can explain at
once with the greatest ease why those things which just before
were of a black colour‚ may become all at once of marble white—
ness; as the sea, when mighty winds have stirred up its waters,
is changed into white waves of the brightness of marble: you
may say that when the matter of that which we often see to
be black, has been mixed up anew and the arrangement of its
first-beginnings has been changed and some have been added
and some been taken away, the immediate result is that it
appears bright and white. But if the waters of the sea con—
sisted of azure seeds, they could in no wise become white3 for
however much you jumble together seeds which are azure, they
can never pass into a marble colour‚ But if the seeds which
make up the one unmixed brightness of the sea are dyed some
with one, some with other colours, just as often out of different
forms and varied shapes something square and of a uniform
figure is made up, in that case it were natural that as we see
unlike forms contained in the square, so we should see in the
water of the sea or in any other one and unmixed brightness
colours widely unlike and different to one another. Moreover
the unlike figures do not in the least hinder or prevent the whole
figure from being a square on the outside; but the various colours
of things are a let and hindrance to the whole things being of a
uniform brightness.

Then too the reason which leads and draws us on sometimes
