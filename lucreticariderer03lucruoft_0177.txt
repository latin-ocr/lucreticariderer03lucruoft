cold when it has pierced into our frames to the very marrow, sets
them a-shivering in spite of themselves, forcing them to shake
and move. Men are therefore disturbed by a twofold terror
throughout their cities: they fear the roofs above their heads, they
dread lest the nature of the earth in a moment break up her
caverns underneath, and rent asunder display her own wide—gaping
maw and wildly tumbled together seek to fill it up with her own
ruins. Let them then fancy as much as they please that heaven
and earth shall be incorruptible and consignes] to an everlasting
exemption from decay3 and yet sometimes the very present force
of danger applies on some side or other this goad of fear among
others, that the earth shall in an instant be withdrawn 110111
under their feet and carried down into the pit, and that the sum
01 things shall utterly give way and follow after and 3 jumbled
wreck of world ensue.

First of all they wonder that nature does not increase the
bulk of the sea, when there is so great a flow of water into it.
when all rivers from all quarters fall into it. Add to these
passing ruins and flying storms, which bespatter every sea and
moisten every land3 add its own springs 3 yet all these compared
with the 311111 01 1116 363 will be like an addition of bulk hardly
amounting to a single drop; it is therefore the less wonderful
that thc great sea does not increase. Again the sun absorbs a
great deal with his heat: we see him with his burning rays
thoroughly dry clothes dripping with wet: but we know seas to
be many in number and to stretch over a wide surface. Therefore
however small the portion of moisture which the sun draws off the
surface from any one spot, it will yet in so vast an expanse take
largely from i ts waters. Then again the winds too may withdraw
3 great deal of 11101311116 33 they sweep over the surface, since we
very often 360 1116 roads dried by the winds in 3 single night and
the soft mud form into hard crusts. Again I have shewn that the
clouds take off much moisture too imbibed from the great surface
of the sca and scatter it about over the whole earth, when it rains
011 land and the winds carry on the clouds. Lastly since the earth
is of 3 porous body and is in contact with the 363, girding its
shores all round, just 33 water comes from the earth into the sea,
in the same way it must ooze into the land out of the salt sea3
for the salt is· strained off and the matter of liquid streams back
