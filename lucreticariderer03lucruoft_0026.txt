Yet 116 and those whom wo have mentioned above immea-
surably inferior and far beneath him, although, the authors of
many excellent and godlike discoveries, they have given responses
from so to say their hearts' holy of holies with more sanctity and
on much more unerring grounds than the Pythia who speaks out
from the tripod and laurel of PhoebuS, have yet gone to ruin in
the first-beginnings of things: it is there they have fallen, and,
great themselves, great and heavy has been that sall; first because
they have banishcd void from things and yet assign to them mo-
110115, and allow things soft and rare, air sun fire earth, living
things and corn, and yet mix not up void in their body3 next be-
cause they suppose that there is no limit to the division of bodies
and no stop set to their breaking and that there exists no least
at all in things3 though we see that that is the bounding point
of any thing which seems to be least to our senses, so that from
this you may infer that because the things which you do not 566
have a bounding point, there is a least in thern. Moreover since
they assign soft first-beginnings of things, which we see to have
birth and to be of a body altogether mortal, the sum of things
must in that case revert to nothing and the store of things be
born anew and flourish out of nothing: how wide now of the truth
both these doctrines are you will already comprehend. In the
next place these bodies are in many ways mutually hostile and
poisonous; and therefore they will either perish when they have
met, or will fly asunder just as we see, when a storm has gathered,
lightnings and rains and winds fly asunder.

Again if all things are produced from four things and all again
broken up into those things, how can they be called first-begin-
nings of things any more than things be called their first-begin-
nings, the supposition being reversed? For they are begotten
time about and interchange colour and their whole nature without
ceasing. But if haply you suppose that the body of fire and of
earth and air aud the moisture of water meet in such a way that
none of them in the union changes its nature, no thing I tell you
can be then produced out of them, neither living thing nor thing
with inanimate body, as a tree; in fact each thing amid the med-
ley of this discordant mass will display its own nature and air will
be seen to be mixed up with earth and heat to remain in union
with moisture. But first-beginnings ought in begetting things to
