one stream of water, yet have all their life a dissimilar appearance
and retain the nature of their parents and severally imitate their
ways each after its kind: so great is the diversity of matter in
any kind of herbage, so great in every river. And hence too any
one you please out of the whole number of living creatures is
made up of bones blood veins heat moisturc flosh sinews; and
these things again differ widely from one another and are com-
posed of first-beginnings of unlike shape. Furthcrmore whatever
things are set on fire and burned, store up in their body, if nothing
else, at least those particleS, out of which they may radiate fire
and send out light and make sparks fly and scatter embers all
about. If you will go over all other things by a like process of
reasoning, you will thus find that they conceal in their body the
seeds of many things and contain elements of various shapes.
Again you see many things to which are given at once both colour
and taste together with smell; especially those many offerings
[which are burned on the altars] These must therefore be made
up of elements of different shapes3 for smell enters in where colour
passes not into the frame, colour too in one way, taste in another
makes its entrance into the senses; so that you know they differ
in the shapes of their first elements. Tli«‚·i·efore unlike forms
unite into one mass and things are made up of a mixture of seed.
Throughout moreover these very verses of ours you see many ele-
ments common to many words, though yet you must admit that
the verses and words one with another are different and composed
of different elements3 not that but few letters which are in com-
mon run through them or that no two words or verses one with
another are made up entirely of the same, but because as a ‘rule
they do not all resemble one the other. Thus also though in other
things there are many first-beginnings common to many things,
yet they can make up one with the other a quite dissimilar
whole; so that men and corn and joyous trees may fairly be said
to consist of different elements.

And yet we are not to suppose that all things can be joined
together in all ways; for then you would see prodigies produced
on all hands, forms springing up half man half beast and some-
times tall boughs sprouting from the living body, and many
limbs of · land-creaturos joined with those of sea-animals, nature
too throughout the all-bearing lands feeding chimeras which
