power. In Syria too as well a spot, we are told, is found to exist
of such a· sort that as soon as ever even fourfooted beasts have
entered in, its mere natural power forces them to fall down heavily,
just as if they were fellcd in a moment as sacrifices to the manes
gods. Now all these things go on by a natural law, and it is
quite plain whence spring the causes from which they are pro-
duced·‚ that the gatc of Orcus be not haply believed to exist in
such spots3 and next we imagine that the manes gods from be-
neath do haply draw souls down from them to the borders of
Acheron3 as wing-footed stags are supposed often by their scent
to draw out from their holes the savage serpent-tribes. How
widely opposed to true reason this is, now learn 3 for now I essay
to tell of the real fact.

F irst of all I say, as I have often said before, that in the earth
are elements of things of every kind: many, which serve for food,
helpful to life; and many whose property it is to cause diseases
and hasten death. And we have shewn before that one thing is
more adapted to one, another thing to another living creature for
the purposes of life, because of their natures and their textures
and their primary elements being all unlike the one to the other.
Many which are noxious pass through the ears, many make their
way too through the nostrils, dangerous and harsh when they
come in contactg and not a few are to be shunned by the touch,
and not a few to be avoided by the sight, and others are nauseous
in taste.

Again you may sec how many things are for man of a viru-
lently noxious sensation and are nauseous and oppressive3 to cer—
tain trees for instance has been given so very oppressivc a shade
that they often cause headaches when a man has lain down under
them extended 011 the grass. There is a tree too on the great
hills of Helicon which has the property of killing a man by the
noisome scent of its ssower. All these things you are to know
rise up out of the earth, because it contains many seeds of many
th'ings in many ways mixed up together and gives them out in a
state of separation. Again when a newly extinguishod night-light
encountcrs the nostrils with its acrid steneli, it sends to sleep then
and there a man who from disease is subject to falling down and
foaming at the mouth. A woman is put to sleep by oppressive
castor and falls back in her seat, and her gay work drops out of
