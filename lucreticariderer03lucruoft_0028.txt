up with different things and in different ways as they move. Nay
you see throughout even in these verses of ours many elementa
common to many words, though you must needs admit that the
lines and words differ one from the other both in meaning and in
the sound wherewith they sound. So much can elements effect
by a mere change of order3 but those elements which are the first-
beginnings of things can bring with them more combinations out
of which different things can severally be produced.

Let us now also examine the homoeomeria of Anaxagoras as the
Greeks term- it, which the poverty of our native speech does not
allow us to name in our own tongue3 though it is easy enough to
set forth in words the thing itself. First of all 111611, when he
speaks of the homoeomeria of thingS, you must know he supposes
bones to bc formed out of very small and minute bones and flesh
of very small and minute fleshes and blood by the coming together
of many drops of blood, and gold he thinks can be composed of
grains of gold and earth be a concretion of small earths, and fires
can come from fires and water from waters, and everything else he
fancies and supposes to be produced on a like principle. And yet
at the same time he does not allow that void exists anywhere in
things, or that there is a limit to the division of things. Where-
fore he appears tome 011 100111 111656 grounds to be as much mis-
taken as those whom we ¹have already spoken of above. Moreover
the first-beginnings which he supposes are too frail3 if first-begin-
nings they be which are possessed of a nature like 10 the things
themselves and are just as liable to suffering and death, and which
nothing reins back from destruction. For which of them will hold
out, so as to escape death, beneath 50 strong a pressure within the
very jaws of destruction? fire or water 01 air? which of these?
blood or bones? Not one methinks‚ where everything will be just
as essentially mortal as those things which we see with the senses
perish before our eyes vanquished by some force. But I appeal to
facts demonstrated above for proof that things cannot fall away to
nothing nor 011 1116 other hand grow from nothing. Again since
food gives increase and nourishment to the body, you are to know
that our veins and blood and bones [and the like are formed of
things foreign to them in kind]; or if they shall say that all foods
are of a mixed body and contain in them small bodies of sinews
and bones and veins as well and particles of blood, it will follow
