36 they know that the 6611666 36 well suffer dissolution each in its
own place. But if our mind were immortal, it would not when
dying cornplain so much of its dissolution, 36 01 passing abroad
and quitting its vesture, like a snake.

Again why are the mind's understanding and judgment never
begotten in the head or feet or hands, but cling in all alike 10 0116
spot and fixcd quarter, if it be not that particular places are
assigned for the birth 01 evei-ything, and [nature has determinod]
where each is to continue to exist after it is born? [Our body
then must follow the same law] and have such a manifold organi-
sation of parts, that 110 perverted arrangement of its members
shall ever shew itself: so invariably effect follows cause, nor is
flame wont to be born in rivers nor cold in fire.

Again 11 1116 nature 01 1116 60111 16 111111101131 and can feel when
separated from our body, methinks we must suppose it to be pro-
vided with five senses3 and in no other way can we picture to
ourselves souls below flitting about Acheron. Painters therefore
and former generations of writers have thus represented souls
provided with senses. But neither eyes nor nose nor hand can
exist for the soul apart 110111 1116 body nor can tongue, nor can
ears perceive by'the sense 01 hearing or exist for the soul by
themselves apart from the body.

And since we perceive that vital sense is in the whole body
and we see that it is all endowed with life, if on a sudden any
force with swift blow shall have cut it in twain 60 36 quite to
dissever the two halves, the power 01 1116 60111 will without doubt
at the same time be cleft and cut asunder and dashed in twain
together with the body. But that which is cut and divides into
any parts, you are to know disclaims for itself an everlasting
nature. Stories are told how scythed chariots reeking with in-
discriminate slaughter 011611 lop off limbs so instantaneously that
that which 1136 1311611 down lopped 011 110111 1116 1131116 16 66611 10

from the suddenness of the mischief cannot feel the pain3 and
because his mind once 101 311 16 wholly given to the business of
fighting, with what 1611131116 01 1116 body he iningles in the fray
and carnage, and often perceives not that the wheels and de-
