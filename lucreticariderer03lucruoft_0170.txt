stroke, the elements of heat arc able to stream together out of the
wind itself and at the same time out of the thing which then
encountcrs the stroke. Thus, when we strike a stone with iron‚
fire fiies out3 and none the less, because the force of the 11011
13 cold, do its secds of fiery brightness meet together upon the
stroke. Thereforc in the same way too a thing ought to be set on
firc by the thunderbolt, if it has happened to be in a state suited
to receive and susceptible of the flames. At the same time the
might of the wind cannot lightly be thought to be absolutely and
decidedly cold, seeing that it is discharged with such force from
above; but if it is not already set 011 fire during its course, it yet
arrives in a warm state with heat mixed up in it.

But the velocity of thunderbolts is great and their stroke
powerfuhand they run through their course with a rapid descent‚
because their force when set in motion first in all cases collects
itself in the clouds and gathers itself up for a great effort at start-
ing3 then when the cloud is no longer able to hold the increased
moving power, their force is pressed out and therefore flies with a
marvellous moving power, like to that with which missiles are
carried when discharged from powerful engines. Then too the
thunderbolt consists of small and smooth elements, and such a
nature it is not easy for anything to withstand3 for it flies between
and passes in through the porous passages3 therefore it is not
checked and delayed by many collisions, and for this reason it
glides and flies on with a swift moving power. Next, all weights
without exception naturally pressing dowmvard, when to this a
blow is added, the velocity is doubled and yon moving power
becomes so intense that the thunderbolt dashes aside more impe-
tuously and swiftly whatever gets in its way and tries to hinder it,
and pursues its journey. Then too as it advances with a long-
continued moving power, it must again and again receive new
velocity which ever increases as it goes on and augments its
powerful might and gives vigour to its stroke ; for it forces all the
seeds of the thunder to be borne right onward to one spot so to
speak, throwing them all together, as on they roll, into that single
line. Perhaps too as it goes on it atti-acts certain bodies out of
the air itself, and these by their blows kindle apace its velocity.
It passes too through things without injuring them, and leaves
many things quite whole after it has gone through, because the
