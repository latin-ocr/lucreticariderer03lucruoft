raccs and gave birth to the huge bodies of wild bcasts. For
methinks no golden chain let down to earth from heaven above
the races of mortal beings, nor did the sea and waves which lash
the rocks produco them, but the same earth bare them which
now feeds thern out of herself. Moreover she first spontaneously
of herself produced for mortals goodly corn-crops and joyous
vineyards3 of herself gave sweet fruits and glad pastures; which
now-a-days scarce attain any size when furthered by our labour:
we exhaust the oxen and the strength of the husband1nen3 we
wear out our* iron, scarcely fed after all by the tilled fields; so
niggardly are they of their produce and after so much labour
do they let it grow. And now the aged ploughman shakes his
head and sighs again and again to think that the labours of
his hands have come to nothing3 and when he compares pre-
sent times with times past, he often praises the fortunes of his
sire and harps on the theme, how the men of old rich in piety
comfortably supported life on a scanty plot of ground, since the
allotment of land to each man was far less of yore than now.
The sorrowful planter too of the exhausted and shrivelled vine
impeaches the march of time and wear-ies heaven, and compre-
hends not that all things are gradually wasting away and passing
to the grave, quiterforspent by age and length of days.
