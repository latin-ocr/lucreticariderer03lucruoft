rather make an end of life and travail? for there is nothing
more which I can contrive and discover for thee to give plea-
surc: all things are ever the same. Though thy body is not
yet decayed with years nor thy frame worn out and exhausted,
yet all things rcmain the same, ay though in length of life thou
shouldst outlast all races of things now living, nay even more
if thou shouldst never die', what answer have we to make save
this, that nature sets up against us a well-founded claim and
puts forth in her pleading a true indictment? If however one of
greater age and more advanced in years should complain and
lamcnt poor wretch his death more than is right, would she
not with greater cause raise her voice and rally him in sharp
accents, ‘away from this time forth with thy tears, rasca13 a

which though will follow thee when they have finished their term
of life3 and thus it is that all these no 1633 than thou have before
this come to an end and hereafter will come to an end. Thus one
thing will never cease to rise out of another, and life is granted to
none in see-simple, to all 111 usufruct. Think too how the bygone
antiquity of everlasting time before our birth was nothing to us.
Nature therefore holds this up to us as a mirror of the time yet to
come aster our death. Is there aught in this that looks appalling,
aught that wears an aspect of gloom? is it not more untroubled
than any sleep ,ἲ
