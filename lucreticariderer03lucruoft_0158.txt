sayed to send savagc boars against tho enemy, And some sent
before them valorous lions with armed trainers and courageous
keepcrs to guido them and to hold them in chains; but in vain,
since heated with promiscuous slaughtcr they would disorder in
their rage the troops without distinction, shaking all about the
frightful crests upon their heads ; and the horsemen were not able
to calm the breasts of the horses scared by the roaring and turn
them with the bridle upon the enemy. The 1101103303 with a
spring would throw their enraged bodies on all sides and would
attack in the face tlnfisso who met them, and others off their guard
they would tear down from behind and twining round them would
bring them to the ground overpowered by the wound, fastening

for all the different kinds of wild beasts would fly all abroad;
just as now the lucan kine when cruelly mangled by the steel
fiy often all abroad, after inflicting on their friends many cruel
sufferings. But men chose thus to act not so much in any hope
of victory, as from a wish to give the enemy something to rue at
the cost of their own lives, when they mistrusted their numbers
and were in want of arms.

A garment tied on the body was in use before a dress of
woven stuff. Woven stuff comes after iron, because iron is needed
for weaving a web3 and in no other way 0311 311011 finely polished
things be made, as heddles and spindles‚ shuttles and ringing
yarn-beams. And nature impelled men to work up the wool
