ten at the same time by the heat of the sun, they discharge a
rainy moisture and trickle down, just as wax over a hot fire melts
away and turns fast into liquid. But a violent rain follows, when
the clouds are violently pressed upon by both causes, by their
own accumulated weight and by the impetuous assault of the
wind. And rains are wont to hold out and to last long, when
many seeds of waters are stirred to action, and clouds upon clouds
and rack upon rack welling forth from all quarters round about
are borne along, and when the reeking earth steams moisture
back again from its whole surface. When in such a case the sun
has shone with 1115 rays amid the murky tempest right opposite
the dripping rain-clouds, then the colour of the rainbow shews
itself among the black clouds.

As to the other things which grow by themselves and are
formed by themselves, as well as the things which are formed
within the clouds, all, without exception all, snow winds hail and
cold hoarfrosts and 1115 great force of ice, 1115 great congealing
power of waters, and the stop which everywhere curbs running
rivers, it 15 yet most easy to find out and apprehend in mind how
all 111555 things take place and in what way they are formed, when
you have fully understood the properties assigned to elements.

Now mark and learn what the law of earthquakes is. And
first of all take for granted that the earth below us as well as
above 15 filled in all parts with windy caverns and bears within
its bosom many lakes and many chafflns, cliffs and craggy rocks;
and you must suppose that many rivers hidden beneath the crust
of the earth roll on with violence waves and submerged stones3
for the very nature of the case requires it to be throughout like
to itself. With such things then attached and placed below, the
earth quakes above from the shock of great falling masses‚ when
underneath time has undermined vast cavernsg whole mountains
indeed fall in, and in an instant from the mighty shock trem-
blings spread themselves far and wide from that centre. And
with good cause, since buildings beside a road tremble throughout
when shaken by a waggon of not such very great weight 3 and
they rock no less⁷ where any sharp pebble on the road jolts up
the iron tires of the wheels on both sides. Sometimes too, when
an enormous mass of soil through age rolls down from the land
into great and extensive pools of water, the earth rocks and sways
