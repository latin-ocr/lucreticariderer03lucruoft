that he who exists not, cannot become miserablc, and that it
matters not a whit whether he has been born into life at any
other time, when immortal death has taken away his mortal life.

Therefore when you see a man bemoaning his hard case,
that after death he shall either rot with his body laid in the
grave or be devoured by flames or the jaws of wild beasts, you
may be sure that his ring betrays a flaw and that there lurks in
his heart a secret goad, though he himself declare that he does
not believe that any sense will remain to him after death. He
does not methinks really grant the conclusion which he pro-
fesses to grant nor the principle on which hc so professes, nor
does he take and force himself root and branch out of life, but
all unconsciously imagines something of self to survive. For
when any one in life suggests to himself that birds and beasts
will rend his body after death, he makes moan for himself: he
does not separate himself from that self, nor withdraw himself
fully from the body so thrown out, and fancies himself that
other self and stands by and impregnatcs it with his own sense.
Hence he makes much moan that he has been born mortal, and
sees not that after real death there will be no other self to re-
main in life and lament to sels that his own self has met death,
and there to stand and grieve that his own sels there lying is
mangled or burnt. For if it is an evil after death to be pulled
about by the devouring jaws of wild beasts‚ I cannot see why
it should not be a cruel pain to be laid on fires and burn in
hot flames, or to be placed in honey and stified, or to stiffen
with cold‚ stretched on the smooth surface of an icy slab of
stone, or to be pressed down and crushed by a load of earth
above.

‘Now no more shall thy house admit thee with glad wel·
come, nor a most virtuous wife and sweet children run to be
the first to snatch kisses and touch thy heart with a silent joy.
No more mayst thou be prosperous in thy doings‚ a safeguard
to thine own. One disastrous (lay has taken from thee luckless
man in luckless wise all the many prizes of life’. This do men
say3 but add not thereto ‘and now no longer does any craving
for these things beset thee withal'. For if they could rightly
perceive this in thought and follow up the thought in words,
they would release themselves from great distrcss and appre-
