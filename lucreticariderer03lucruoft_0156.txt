strong wind passes over the sea and sweeps over its waters the
commander of a fleet together with his mighty legions and ele-
phants, does he not draw near with vows to seek the mercy of
the gods and ask in prayer with soar and trembling a lull in the
wincls and propitious gales 3²*but all in vain} since often caught up
in the furious hurricane he is borne none the less to the shoalsof
death? so constantly does some hidden power trample on human
grandeur and is seen to tread under its heel and make sport l'or

whole earth rocks under their feet and towns tumble with the
shock or doubtfully threaten to fall, what wonder that mortal men

toils and stirring it with dogs. Whatever the fact is, from what-

 

ever cause the heat of flame had swallowed up the forests with a
frightful crackling from their very roots and had thoroughly baked
the earth with fire, there would run from the boiling veins and
collect into the hollows of the ground a stream of silver and gold,
as well as of copper and lead. And when they saw these after-
wards cool into lumps and glitter on the earth with a brilliant
gleam, they would lift thern up attracted by the bright and polish-
ed lustre, and they would see them to be moulded in a shape the
same as the outline of the cavities in which each lay. Then it
would strike thern that these might be melted by heat and cast
in any form or shape soever, and might by hammering out be
brought to tapering points of any degree of sharpness and fineness‚
so as to furnish them with tools and enable them to cut the forests
and hew timber and plane smooth the planks, and also to drill and
