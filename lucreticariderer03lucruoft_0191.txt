the cool rivers, throwing their body naked into the water. Many
tumbled headforexnost deep down into the wells, meeting the
water straight with mouth wide-agape, Parching thirst with a
craving not to be appeased, drenching their bodies, would make
an abundant draught no better than the smallest drop. No 165-
pite was there of ill: their bodies would lie quite spent. The
hcaling art would mutter low in voiceless fear, as again and again
they rolled about their eye-balls wide open, burning with disease‚
never visited by sleep. And many symptoms of death besides
would then be given, the mind disordered in sorrow and sear, the
clouded brow, the fierce delirious expression, the ears too troubled
and filled with ringings, the breathing quick or else strangely loud
and slow-recurring, and the sweat glistening wet over the neck,
the spittle in thin small fiakes‚ tinged with a saffron-colour, salt,

and some from excessive dread of the gates of death would live
bereaved of these parts by the knife; and some though without
hands and feet would continue in life, and some would lose their
eyes: with such force had the sear of death come upon them.
And some were seized with such utter loss of memory that they
did not know themselves. And though bodies lay in heaps above

bodies unburied on the ground, yet would the race of birds and
beasts either scour far away, to escape the acrid stench‚ or where
