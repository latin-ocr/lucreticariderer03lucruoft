from another. It must follow therefore that any one sense cannot
confute any other. No nor ean any sense take itself to task,
since equal eredit must be assigned to it at all times. What
therefore has at any time appeared true to each sense, is true.
And if reason shall be unable to explain away the cause why
things which close at hand were square, at a distance looked
round, it yet is better, is you are at a loss for the reason, to state
erroneously the causes of each shape, than to let slip from your
grasp on any side things manifest and ruin the groundwork of
belief and wrench up all the foundations on which rest life and
existence. For not only would all reason give way, life itself
would at once fall to the ground, unless you ehoose to trust the
senses and shun preeipiees and all things else of this sort that are
to be avoided, and to pursue the opposite things. All that host
of words then be sure is quite unmeaning, which has been drawn
out in array against the senses. Once more, as in a building, if
the rule first applied is wry, and the square is untrue and swerves
from its straight lines, and if there is the slightest hitch in any
part of the level, all the construction must be faulty, all must be
wry erooked sloping, leaning forwards, leaning backwards, without
symmetry, so that some parts seem ready to fall, others do fall,
ruined all by the first erroneous measurements; so too all reason
of things must needs prove to you distorted and false, which is
founded on false senses.

And now to explain in what way the other senses do each
perceive their several objects, is the nowise arduous task which
is still left.

In the first place all sound and voice is heard when they have
made their way into the ears and have struck with their body
the sense of hearing. For voice too and sound you must admit to
be bodily, since they are able to act upon the senses. Again voice
often abi-ades the throat‚ and shouting in passing forth makes the
windpipe more rough: when to wit the first-beginnings of voices
have risen up in larger mass and eommenced to pass abroad
through their strait passage, you are to know the door of the
mouth now crammed itself is abraded. There is no doubt then
that voices and words consist of bodily first-beginnings, with the
power to hurt3 nor ean you fail to know how much of body is
taken away and how much is withdrawn from men's very sinews
