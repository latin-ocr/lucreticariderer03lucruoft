no night ever followed day nor morning night that heard not
mingling with the sickly infant’s cries wailings the attendants ou
death and black funeral.

And hei-ein it is proper you should keep under seal, and guard,
there consigned, in faithful memory this truth‚ that there is nothing
whose nature is apparent to sense, which consists of one kind of
first-beginnings3 nothing which is not formed by a mixing of seed.
And whenever a thing possesses in itself in larger measure many
powers and properties, in that measure it shews that there are in
it the greatest number of different kinds and varied shapes of
first-beginnings. First of all the earth has in her first bodies out
of which springs rolling coolness along replenish without fail the
boundless sea, she has bodies out of which fires rise up; for in
many spots the earth's crust is on fire and burns, though head-
strong Aetna rages with fire of surpassing force. Then too she

in choice positions she sustains towns; adorned with which em-
blem the image of the divine mother is carried now-a-days through
wide lands in awe-inspiring state, Her different nations after
old-established ritual term Idaean mother, and give for escort
Phrygian bands, because they tell that from those lands corn first
began to be produced throughout the world. They assign her
galli, because they would shew by this type that they who have
done violence to the divinity of the mother and have proved un-
grateful to their parents, are to be deemed unworthy to bring a
living offspring into the borders of light. Tight-stretched tambour-
ines and hollow cymbals resound all round to the stroke of their
open hands, and horns menace with hoarse-sounding music, and
