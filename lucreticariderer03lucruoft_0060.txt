which we see to have sense, just as well be made up of a mixture
of things altogether devoid of sense ἲ

Again we are all sprung from a heavenly seed, all have that
same father, by whom mother earth the giver of increase, when
she has taken in from him liquid drops of moisture, conceives
and bears goodly crops and joyous trees and the race of man,
bears 311 kinds of brute beasts, in that she supplies food with
which all seed their bodies and lead a pleasant life and continue
their race3 wherefore with good cause she has gotten the name
of mother. ‘That- also which before was from the earth, passes
back into the earth, and that which was sent from the borders
ofiether, is carried back and taken in again by the quarters of
heaven. Death does not extinguish things in such a way as to
destroyhthe bodies of matter, but only breaks up the union
ainongst them, and then joins anew the different elements with
others3 and thus it comes to pass that all things change their
shapes and alter their colours and receive sensations and in a
moment yield them up3 so that from all this you may know it
matters much with what others and in what position the same
first-beginnings of things are held in union and what motions
they do mutually impart and receive, and you must not sup-
pose that that which we see floating about on the surface of
things and now born, then at once perishing‚ can be a property
inherent in everlasting first bodies. Nay in our verses them-
selves it matters much with what other elements and in what
kind of order the several elements are placed. If not all, yet
by far the greatest number are alike3 but the totals composed
of them are made to differ by the position of these elements.
Thus in actual things as well when the clashings motions ar-
rangement position and shapes of matter change about, the things
must also change.

Apply now, we entreat, your mind to true reason. For a
new question struggles earnestly to gain your earS, a new aspect
of things to display itself. But there is nothing so easy as
not to be at first more difficult to believe than afterwards3
and nothing too so great, so marvelhus that all do not gradu-
ally abate their admiration of it. Look up at the bright and
unsullied hue of heaven and the stars which it holds within
it, wandering all about, and the moon and the sun's light of
