Again to say that all things are fire and that no real thing
except fire exists in the number of things, as this same man does,
appears to be sheer dotage. For he himself takes his stand on
the side of the senses to fight against the senses and shakes their
authority, on which rests all our belief, ay from which this fire as
he calls it is known to himself 3 for he believes that the senses
can truly perceive fire, he does not believe they can perceive all
other things which are not a whit less clear. Now this appears
to me to be as false as it is foolish: for to what shall we appeal?
what surer test can we have than the senseS, whereby to note
truth and falsehood? Again why should any one rather abolish
all things and choose to leave the single nature of heat, than
deny that fires exist, while he allows any thing else to be? it
seems to be equal madness to affirm either this or that.

For these reasons they who have held that fire is the matter of
things and that the sum can be formed out of fire, and they who
have determined air to be the first-beginning in begetting things,
and all who have held that water by itself alone forms things, or
that earth produces all things and changes into all the different
natures of things, appear to have strayed exceedingly wide of the
truth3 as well as they who make the first-beginnings of things
twofold coupling air with fire and earth with water, and they who
believe that all things grow out of four things, fire earth and air
and water. Chief of whom is Agrigentine Empedocles: him within
the three-cornered shores of its lands that island bore, about which
the Ionian sea flows in large crankhngs, and splashes up brine
from its green waves. Here the sea racing in its straitened frith
divides by its waters the shores of Italia's lands from the other's
coasts3 here is wasteful Charybdis and here the rumblings of
Aetna threaten anew to gather up such fury of flames, as again
with force to belch forth the fires bursting from its throat and
carry up to heaven once more the lightnings of flame. Now
though this great country is seen to deserve in many ways the
wonder of mankind and is held to be well worth visiting‚ rich in
all good things, guarded by large force of men, yet seems it to
have held within it nothing more glorious than this man, nothing
more holy marvellous and dear. The verses too of his godlike
genius cry with a loud voice and set forth in such wise his glorious
discoveries that he hardly seems born of a mortal stock.
