from things and to go back again into things, since it is a 1601
11161 611 things constantly ebb.

Likewise the abundant source of clear light, the ethereal sun,
constantly floods heaven with fresh brightness and supplies the
place of light on the instant by new light ; for every previous emis·
sion of brightness is quite lost to it, wherever it falls. This you
may know from the following examples: as soon as ever clouds
begin to pass below the sun and to break off so to say the rays of
light, forthwith their lower part is wholly lost, 61111 1116 661111 15
overshadowed wherever the clouds pass over3 so that you may
know that things constantly require new irradiation and that all
the preceding emissions of light are lost, and in no other way can
things be seen in the sun, unless the fountain head of light itself
send a supply. Moreover, you see, nightly lights which belong 10
661111, such as hanging lamps and torches bright with darting
flames, hasten in like fashion 6111111 81661 Harkness with minister-
ing 11661 10 supply new light3 are eager 10 bicker with fires, ay
eager; nor is the light ever broken off nor does it quit 1116 spots
illuminated: with such suddenness 15 its destruction concealed by
the swift birth 01 fiame from all the 11165 61 01106. In the 561116
way 111611 we must believe 11161 51111 1110011 61111 51615 611111 118111
from fresh and ever fresh supplies rising up, and always lose every
previous discharge of flames3 that you may not haply believe that
111656 1101111511 indestructible.

Again see you not that even stones are conquered by time,
that high towers fall and rocks moulder away, that shrines and
111015 01 80115 616 worn 0111 with decay, and that the holy divinity
cannot prolong the bounds of fate or struggle against the fixed
laws of nature? Then see we 1101 1116 monuments of men, fallen
10 111111, ask for themselves as well whether you’d believe that theg]
decay with years? see we not basalt rocks tulnble down riven
away from high mountains and unable 10 endure and suffer the
strong might of finite age? surely they would never fall suddenly
thus riven away, if for infinite time past they had held out against
all the batteries of age without a crash.

Again gaze 011 11115, which about and above holds in its 6111-
1)1606 611 1116 earth: if it begets all things out of itself, 65 501116
