cover the eyes‚ the ears ring, the limbs sink under one; in short
we often sec 111011 drop down from terror of mind3 so that any-
body may easily perceive from this that the soul is closely united
with the mind, and, when it has been smitten by the infiuence of
the mind, forthwith pushes and strikes the body.

This same principle teaches that the nature of the mind and
soul is bodily3 for when it is seen to push the limbs, rouse the
body from sleep, and alter the countenance and guide and turn
about the whole 111011, and when we see that none of these effects
can take place without touch nor touch without body, must we
not admit that the mind and the soul are of a bodily nature?
Again you perceive that our mind in our body suffers together
with 1110 body and feels in unison with it. When a weapon with
a shudder-causing force has been driven in and has laid bare bones
and sinews within the body, if it does not take life, yet there
01151105 0 faintness and 0 lazy sinking to the ground and on the
ground the turmoil of mind which arises, and sometimes 0 kind
of undecided inclination 10 get up. Therefore the nature of the
mind must be bodily, since it suffers from bodily weapons and
blows.

I will now go 011 10 explain in my verses of what kind of body
the mind consists and out of what it is formed. First of all I say
that it is extremely fine and formed of exceedingly minute bodies.
That this is 50 you may, if you please to attend, clearly perceive
from what follows: nothing that 15 seen takes place with a ve-
locity equal to that of the mind when it starts some suggestion
and actually sets it agoing; the mind therefore is stirred with
greater rapidity than any of the things whose nature stands out
visible to sight. But that which is so passing nimble, must con-
· sist of seeds exceedingly round and exceedingly minute, in order
to be stirred and set in motion by a small moving power. Thus
water is 111ονοἀ and heaves by ever so small a force, formed as it
15 of small particles apt to roll. But on the other hand the nature
of honey 15 more sticky, its liquid more sluggish and its movement
more dilatory3 for the whole mass of matter coheres more closely,
because sure enough it is made of bodies not so smooth fine and
round. A breeze however gentle and light can force, as you may
see, a high heap of poppy seed to be blown away from the top
clownwards3 but on the other hand eurus itself cannot move a
