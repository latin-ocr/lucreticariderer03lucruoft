creatures cannot reckon up, and if the same force and nature
abide in them and have the power to throw the seeds of things
together into their several places in the same way as they are
thrown together into our world, you must admit that in other
parts of space there are other earths and various races of men
and kinds of wild beasts.

Moreover in the sum of all there is no one thing which is
begotten single in its kind and grows up single and sole of its
kind3 but a thing always belongs to some class and there are
many other things in the same kind. First in the case of living
things, most noble Memmius, you will find that in this sort has
been begotten the mountain-ranging race of wssd beasts, in this
sort the breed of men, in this sort too the mute shoals of scaly
creatures and all bodies of fowls. Wherefore on a like principle
you must admit that earth and sun moon sea and all things else
that are, are not single in their kind, but rather in number past
numbering3 since the deep-set boundary-mark of life just as
much awaits these and they are just as much of a body that
had birth, as any class of things which here on earth abounds in
samples of its kind.

If you well apprehend and keep in mind these things, nature
free at once and rid of her haughty lords is seen to do all things
spontaneously of herself without the meddling of the gods. For
I appeal to the holy breasts of the gods who in tranquil peace
pass a calm time and an unruffied existence, who can rule the
suni, who hold in his hand with controlling force the strong
reins, of the immeasurable deep? who can at once make all the
different heavens to roll and warm with ethereal fires all the
fruitful earths, or be present in all places at all times, to bring
darkness with clouds and shake with noise the heaven’s serene
expanse, to hurl lightnings and often throw down his own tem-
ples, and withdrawing into the deserts there to spend his rage
in practising his bolt which often passes the guilty by and
strikes dead the innocent and unoffending?

And since the birth-time of the world and first day of being
to sea and earth and the formation of the sun many bodies have
been added from without, many seeds added all round, which the
great universe in tossing to and fro has cont-ributed3 that fi¹om
them the sea and lands might increase and from them heaven's
