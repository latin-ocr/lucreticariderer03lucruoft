conveyed from us reaches the mirror and 111011 10 reflected and
comes back 10 our eyes, and drives on and rolls in front of it a
second air and lets us see this before itself, and for this reason it
looks so far withdrawn from the mirror. Wherefore again and
again I repeat there is no cause at all to wonder why the images
give back the reflexion from the surface of mirrors in the spot
they do, since in both the given cases the result is produced by
two airs. Το proceed, the right side of our body is seen in
mirrors to be on the left, because when the image comes and
strikes on the plane 01 1110 mirror, it is not turned back unaltered‚
but is beaten out in a right line backwards, just as if you were
to take a plaster mask before it is dry and dash it on a pillar or
beam, and it forthwith were to preserve the lines of its features
undistorted in front and were 10 0111κο out an exact copy of itself
straight backwards. The result will 110 that the eye which was
right will now be left; and conversely the left become 1110 right.
An image may also be so transmitted from one mirror to another
that five or six idols are 011011 produced. And thus all 1110 things
which lurk in the inmost corners of a house, however far they
are withdrawn 11110 tortuous recesses, may yet be all brought out
through winding passages by the aid of a number 01 1111110Γο
and be seen 10 be in the house. So unfailingly does the image
reflect itself from 11111101 10 mirror; and when the 1011 01άο 10 pre-
sented, it becomes the right in the new image3 then it is changed
back again and turns round to what it was. Moreover all little
sides of mirrors which possess a curvature resembling our side,
send back to us idols with their right corresponding to our right
either for this reason, because the image is transmitted from one
mirror to another, and then after it has been twice struck out
flies 10 110, 01 0100 because the image, when it has come to the
mirror, wheels about, because the curved shape of the mirror
tcaches it to turn round and face us. Again you would think
that idols step out and put down their foot at the same time with
us and mimic our action, because from before whatever part of a
mirror you move away, from that part forthwith no idols can
be reflected; since nature constrains all things, when they are
carried back and recoil from things, 10 110 given back at angles
equal 10 111000 at which they impinged.

Bright things again the eyes eschew and shun to look upon:
