bring with them a latent and unseen nature in order that no
thing stand out, to be in the way and prevent whatever is pro-
duced from having its own proper being.

Moreover they go back to heaven and its fires for a beginning,
and first suppose that fire changes into air, next that from air
water is begotten and earth is produced out of water, and that all
in reverse order come back from earth, water first, next air, then
heat, and that these cease not to interchange, to pass from heaven
to earth, from earth to the stars of ether. All which first-begin-
nings must on no account do3 since something unchangeable must·
needs remain over, that things may not utterly be brought back to
nothing. For whenever a thing changes and quits its proper
limits, at once this change of state is the death of that which was
before. Wherefore since those things which we have mentioned a
little before pass into a state of change, they must be formed out
of others which cannot in any case be transformed, that you may not
have things returning altogether to nothing. Why not rather hold
that there are certain bodies possessed of such a nature, that, if
they have haply produced fire, the same may, after a few have
been taken away and a few added on and the order and motion
changed, produce air; and that all other things may in the same
way interchange with one another?

‘ But plain matter of fact clearly proves' you say ‘that all things
grow up into the air and are fed out of the earth 3 and unless the
season at the propitious period send such abundant showers that
the trees reel beneath the soaking storms of rain, and unless the
sun on its part foster them and supply heat, corn trees and living
things could not grow’. Quite true, and unless solid food and soft
water should recruit us, our substance would waste away and life
break wholly up out of all the sinews and bones; for we beyond
doubt are recruited and fed by certain things, this and that other
thing by certain other things. Because many first-beginnings
common to many things in many ways are mixed up in things,
therefore sure enough different things are fed by different
things. And it often makes a great difference with what
things and in what position the same first-beginnings are
held in union and what motions they mutually impar-t and
receive3 for the same make up heaven sea lands rivers sun, the
same make up corn trees and living things3 but they are mixed
