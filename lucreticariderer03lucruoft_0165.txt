levels of the wide-stretching upper world, just as at times a can-
vas-awning stretched over large theatres makes a creaking noise,
when it tosses about among the poles and beams 3 sometimes too
rent by the boisterous gales it madly howls and closely imitates
the rasping noise of pieces of paper: for this kind of noise too
you may observe in thunder: you may observe again the sound
which is heard when the winds whirl about with their blows
and buffet through the air either a hanging cloth or flying bits
of paper. For sometimes the clouds cannot meet front to front
in direct collision, but must rather move from the flank and so
with contrary motions graze leisurely along each other's bodies3
whence comes that dry sound which brushes the ears and is long
drawn out, until they have made their way out of their confined
positions.

In this way also all things appear to quake often from the
shock of heavy thunder, and the mighty walls of the farstretching
ether seem in an instant to have been riven and to have sprung
asunder 3 when a storln of violent wind has suddenly gathered and
worked itself into the clouds and, there shut in, with its whirling
eddy ever more and more on all sides forces the cloud to become
hollow with a thick surrounding crust of body3 afterwards when
its force and impetuous onset have split it, then the cloud thus
rent gives forth a crash with a frightful hurtling noise. And no
wonder, when a small bladder filled with air often emits a hideous
sound if suddenly burst.

It can also be explained how the winds, when they blow
through the cloudS, make noises: we see branching and rough
clouds often borne along in many ways; thus, you are to know,
when the blasts of the northwest blow through a dense forest, the
leaves give forth a rustling and the boughs a crashing. Some-
times too the force of the strong wind in rapid motion rends the
cloud, breaking through it by an assault right in front: what a
blast of wind can do there, is shewn by facts plain to sense, when
here on earth where it is gentler it yet twists out tall trees and
tears them up from their deepest roots. There are also waves
among the clouds and they give a kind of roar as they break
heavily3 just as in deep rivers and on the great sea when the
surf breaks. Sometimes too when the burning force of thunder
has fallen out of one cloud into another, if haply the latter con-
