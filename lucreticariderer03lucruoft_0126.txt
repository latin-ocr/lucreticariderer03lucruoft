speech by the names conferrcd on things3 and also in what ways
yon soar of the gods gained an entry into men's breasts, and now
throughout, the world maintains as holy fanes lakes groves altars
and idols of thc gods. F urthermore I shall make clear by what
force piloting nature guides the courses of the sun and the wander-
ings of the moon; lest haply we imagine that these of their
own frce will between heaven and earth traverse their everlasting
orbits, graciously furthering the increase of crops and living crea-
tures, or we think they roll on by any forethought of the gods.
For they who have been rightly taught that the gods lead a life
without care, if nevertheless they wonder by what plan all things
can be carried on, above all in rcgard to those things which are
seen overhead in the ethereal borders, are borne back again into
their old religious scruples and take unto themselves hard task-
masters, whom they poor wretches believe to be almighty‚ not
knowing what can, what cannot be, in short by what system each
thing has its powers defined, its deep-set boundary mark.

Well then not to detain you any longer by mere promises,

look before all on seas and lands and heaven: their threefold ,

nature, their three bodies, Memmius three forms so unlike, three
such wondrous textures a single day shall give over to destruction3
and the mass and fabric of the world upheld for many years
shall tumble to ruin. Nor cau I fail to perceive with what a
novel and strange effect it falls upon the mind, this destruction of
heaven and earth that is to be, and how hard it is for me to pro·
duce a full conviction of it by words3 as is the case when you
bring to the ears a thing hitherto unexampled, and yet you cannot
submit it to the eyesight nor put it into the hands; through which
the straightest highway of belief leads into the human breast
and quarters of the mind. But yet I will speak out: it well may
be that the reality itself will bring credit to my words and that
you will see earthquakes arise and all things grievously shattered
to pieces in a short time. But this may pilot fortune guide far
away from us, and may reason rather than the reality convince
that all things may be overpowered and tumble in with a fright-
ful crash.

But before I shall begin on this question to pour forth decrees
of fate with more sanctity and much more certainty than the
Pythia who speaks out from the tripod and laurel of Phoebus
