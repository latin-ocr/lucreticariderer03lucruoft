matter, disordered by the shock through the whole frame, unties
from the body the vital fastenings of the soul and scatters it
abroad and forces it out through all the pores. For what more
can we suppose the infliction of a blow can do, than shake from
their place and break up the union of the several elements?
Often too when the blow is inflicted with less violence, the re—
maining vital motions are wont to prevail, ay, prevail and still
the huge disorders caused by the blow and recall each part
into its proper channels and shake off the motion of death now
reigning as it were paramount in the body and kindle afresh the
almost lost senses. For in what other way should the thing be
able to gather together its powers of mind and come back to
life from the very threshold of death, rather than pass on to the
goal to which it had almost run and so pass away?

Again since there is pain when the bodies of matter are
disordered by any force throughout the living flesh and frame
and quake in their seats within, and as when they travel back
into their place, a soothing pleasure ensues, you are to know
that first-beginnings can be assailed by no pain and can derive
no pleasure from themselves3 since they are not formed of any
bodies of first—beginnings, so as to be distressed by any novelty
in their motion or derive from it any fruit of fostering deIight,
and therefore they must not be possessed of any sense.

Again if in order that living creatures may severally have
sense, sense is to be assigned to their first-beginnings 55 well,
what are we to say of those of which mankind is specifically
made? sure enough they burst into fits of shaking laughter
and sprinkle with dewy tears face and cheeks and have the cun-
ning to say much about the composition of things and to enquire
next what their own first-beginnings are, since like in their
natures to the entire mortals they must in their turn be formed
out of other elements, then those others out of others, so that
you can venture nowhere to come to a stop: ycs, whatever you
shall say speaks and laughs and thinks, Ι will press you with
the argument that it is formed of other things performing these
same acts. But if we see these notions to be sheer folly and
madness, and a man may laugh though not made of laughing
things, and think and reason in learned language though not
formed of thoughtful and eloquent seeds, why cannot the things
