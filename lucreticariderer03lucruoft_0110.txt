which are formed by compounding the shapes of these. For as-
suredly no image of Centaur is formed out of a live one, since
no such nature of living creature ever existed; but when images
of a horse and a man have by chance come together, they readily
adhere at once, as we said before, on account of their fine nature
and thin texture. All other things of the kind are produced in
like fashion. And when these from extreme lightness are borne
on with velocity‚ as I shewed before, any one subtle composite
image you like readily moves the mind by a single stroke; for the
mind is fine and is itself wondrously nimble.

That all this is done as I relate you may easily learn from
what follows. So far as the one is like the other, seeing with
the mind and seeing with the eyes must be produced in a like
way. Well then since I have shewn that I perceive for instance
a lion by means of idols which provoke the eyes, you may be sure
that the mind is moved in a like way, which by means of idols
sees a lion or anything else just as well as the eyes, with this
difference that it perceives much thinner idols. And when sleep
has prostrated the body, for no other reason does the mind's in-
telligence wake, except because the very same idols provoke our
minds which provoke them when we are awake, and to such a
degree that we seem without a doubt to pereeive him whom life
has left and death and earth gotten hold of. This nature eon-
strains to come to pass because all the senses of the body are then
hampered and at‘rest throughout the limbs and cannot refute the
unreal by real things. Moreover memory is prostrate and relaxed
in sleep and protests not that he has long been in the grasp of
death and destruction whom the mind believes it sees alive. Fur-
thermore it is not strange that idols move and throw about their
arms and other limbs in regular measure: for sometimes in sleep
an image is seen to do this: when the first to wit has gone and
a second then been born in another posture, that former one
seems to have altered its attitude. This remember you must
assume to take place with exceeding celerity: so great is the velo-
city, so great the store of things3 so great in any one unit of time
that sense ean seize is the store of particleS, out of which the
supply may go on.

And here many questions present themselves and many points
must be cleared up by us, if we desire to give a plain exposition
