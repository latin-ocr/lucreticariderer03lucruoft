ποι-ω IV 89

are seen in a moment of time to glide and spread themselves
through the length and breadth of heaven, fly over sea and
lands and fiood the heaven, what then of those which stand
ready posted in front rank, when they are discharged and
nothing obstructs their egress? how much faster, you see, and
farther must they travel, scouring through many times the
same amount of space in the same time that the sunlight takes
to spread over heaven! This too appears to be an eminently
true proof of the velocity with which idols of things are borne
along: as soon as ever the brightness of water is set down
111 the open air, if the heaven is starry, in a moment the clear
radiant constellations of ether imaged in the water correspond
to those in the heaven. Now do you see in what a moment of
time an image drops down from the borders of heaven to the
borders of earth? Therefore again and again I repeat you
must admit that bodies capable of striking the eyes and of pro-
voking vision [constantly 1317ον01] with a marvellous [velocity].
Smells too incessantly stream from certain things3 as does cold
from rivers, heat from the sun, spray from the waves of the sea,
that eater into walls near the shore. Various sounsls also cease
not to fly through the air. Then too a moist salt flavour often
comes into the mouth, when we are moving about beside the
sea3 and when we look on at the mixing of a decoction of
wormwood, its bitterness affects us. In such a constant stream
from all things the several qualities are carried and are trans-
mitted 111 all directions round, and no delay, no respite in the
fiow is ever granted, since we constantly have feeling, and may at
any time see smell and hear the sound of anything.

Again since a particular figure felt by the hands in the dark
is known to be the same which is seen in the bright light of
day, touch ancl sight must be excited by a quite similar cause.
Well then if we handle a square thing and it excites our atten-
tion in the dark, in the daylight what square thing will be
able to fall on our sight, except the image of that thing?
Therefore the cause of seeing it is plain lies in images and
no thing can be perceived without them. Well the idols of
things I speak of are borne along all round and are discharged
and transmitted in all directions3 but because we can see with
the eyes alone, the consequence is that, to whatever point
