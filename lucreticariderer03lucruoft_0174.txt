the whole sea as well. This makes it- still more plain that many
bodies may likewise rise up out of the salt heaving sea to add
to the bulk of clouds; for the two liquids are near akin in their
nature. Again we sco mists and steam riso out of all rivers and
at the same time from the earth as well 3 and they forced out like
a brcath from these parts aro then carried upwards and overcast
heaven with their darkness and make up clouds on high* as they
gradually come together3 for the heat of starry ether at the same
time presses down too on them and by condensing as it were
weaves a web of clouds below the blue. Sometimes there come
here into heaven from without those bodies which form clouds
and the flying storm-rack3 for I have shewn that their number
passos numbering and that the sum of the deep is infinite3 and I
have proved with what velocity bodies fly and how in a moment
of time they are wont to pass through space unspeakablc. It is
not therefore strange that a tempest and darkness often in a short
time cover over with such great mountains of clouds seas and
lands, as they hang down upon them overhead, since on all sides
through all the cavities of ether and as it were through the vents
of the great world around the power of going out and coming in is
accorded to the elements.

Now mark and I will explain in what way thc rainy moisture
is formed in the clouds above and then is sent down and falls to
the earth in the shape of rain. And first I will prove that many
seeds of water rise up together with the clouds themselves out of
all things and >that both the clouds and the water which 15 111 the
clouds thus increase together3 just 35 our body increases together
with the blood, as well as the sweat and all the moisture which is
in the frame. The clouds likewise imbibe much sea-water as well,
like hanging fleeces of wool, when the winds carry them over the
great sea. In like manner moisture is taken up out of all rivers
into the clouds3 and when the seeds of waters full many 111 num-
ber 111 many ways have met in them, augmented from all sides,
then the close-packed clouds endeavour to discharge their moisture
from two causes: the force of the wind drives them together, and
likewise the very abundance of the rain-clouds, when a greater
mass than usual has been brought together, pushes down, presses
from above and forces the rain to stream out. Again when the
clouds are also rarefied by the winds, or are dispersed, being smit-
