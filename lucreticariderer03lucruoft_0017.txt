distrustful of our words. If there were not void, things could
not move at all; for that which is the property of body, to let
and hinder, would be present to all things at all times3 nothing
therefore could go on, since no other thing would be the first
to give way. But in fact throughout seas and lands and the
heights of heaven we see before our eyes many things move in
many ways for various reasons, which thingS, if there were no
void, I need not say would lack and want restless motion: they
never would have been begotten at all, since matter jammed on
all sides would have been at rest. Again however solid things
are thought to be, you may yet learn from this that they are of
rare body: in rocks and caverns the moisture of water oozes
through and all things weep with abundant drops3 food distri—
butes itself through the whole body of living things; trees grow
and yield fruit in season‚ because food is diffused through the
whole from the very roots over the stem and all the boughs.
Voices pass through walls and fiy through houses shut, stiffening
frost pierces to the bones. Now if there are no void parts, by
what way can the bodies severally pass ἲ You would see it to be
quite impossible. Once more, why do we see one thing surpass
another in weight though not larger in size 2 For if there is just
as much body in a ball of wool as there is in a lump of lead,
it is natural it should weigh the same, since the property of body
is to weigh all things downwards, while on the contrary the nature
of void is ever without weight. Therefore when a thing is just
as large, yet is found to be lighter, it proves sure enough that it
has more of void in it3 while on the other hand that which is
heavier shews that there is in it more of body and that it con-
tains within it much less of void. Therefore that which we are
seeking with keen reason exists sure enough, mixed up in things;
and we call it void.

And herein I am obliged to forestall this point which some
raise, lest it draw you away from the truth. The waters they
say make way for the scaly creatures as they press on, and opcn
liquid paths, because the fish leave room behind them, into which
the yielding waters may stream 3 thus other things too may move
and change place among themselves, although the whole sum be
full. This you are to know has been taken up on grounds wholly
salse. For on what side I ask can the scaly creatures move for-
