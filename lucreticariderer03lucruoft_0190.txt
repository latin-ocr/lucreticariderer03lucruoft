like manner pestilenee often falls on kine also and a distemper
too on the silly sheep. And it makes no difference whether we
travel to places unfavourable to us and change the atmosphere
which wraps us round, or whether nature without our choice brings
to us a tainted atmosphere or something to the use of which we
have not boon accustomed, and which is able to attack us on its
first arrival.

Such a form of disease and a death-fraught miasm erst within
the bordcrs of Cecrops defiled the whole land with dead, and dis-
peopled the streets‚ drained the town of burghers. Rising first
and starting from the inmost corners of Egypt, after traversing
much air and many floating fields, the plague brooded at last over
the whole people of Pandion3 and then they were handed over in
troops to· disease and death. First of all they would have the
head seized with burning heat and both eyes blood-shot with a
glare diffused over3 the livid throat within would exude blood and

with moaning. An ever-recurring hiccup often the night and day
through, forcing on continual spasms in sinews and limbs, would
break men quite, forwearying those forspent before. And yet in
none could you perceive the skin on the surface of the body burn
with any great heat, but the body would rather offer to the hand
a lukewarm sensation and at the same time be red all over with
ulcers burnt into it 50 to speak, like unto the holy fire 65 it
spreads over the fraine. The inward parts of the men however
would burn to the very bones, a flame would burn within the
stomach 65 within furnaces. Nothing was light and thin enough
