for fools, because they have embraced [false principles of reason]
For there can be no centre [where the universe is] infinite3
no nor, even if there were a centre, could anything take up a
position there [any more on that account] than for some quite
different reason [be driven away.] For all room and space, which
we term void, must through centre, through no-centre alike give
place to heavy bodies, in whatever directions their motions tend.
Nor is there any spot of su'ch a sort that when bodies have reached
it, they can lose their force of gravity and stand upon void; and
that again which is void must not serve to support anything‚ but
must, as its nature claves, continually give place. Things cannot
therefore in such a way be held in union, o’er-mastered by love of
a centre.

Again since they do not suppose that all bodies press to the
centre, but only those of earth, and those of water, [both such as
descend to the earth in rain] and those which are held in by the
earth's body, so to say, the fluid of the sea and great waters from
the mountainsg while on the other hand they teach that the
subtle element of air and hot fires at the same time are carried
away from the centre and that for this reason the whole ether
round bickers with signs and the sun's flame is fed throughout
the blue of heaven5 because heat flying from the centre all gathers
together there, and that the topinost boughs of trees could not
put forth leaves at all, unless from time to time [nature supplied]
food from the earth to each [throughout both stem and boughs,
their reasons are not only false, but they contradict each other.
Space I have already proved to be infinite3 and §pace being
infinite matter as I have said must also be infinite]llest after the
winged fashion of flames the walls of the world should suddenly
break up and fly abroad along the mighty void. and all other
things follow for like reasons and the innermost quarters of heaven
tumble in Qm above and the earth in an instant withdraw from
beneath our feet and amid the commingled ruins of things in it
and of heaven, ruins unloosing the first bodies, should wholly pass
away along the unfathomable void, so that in a moment of time
not a wrack should be left behind, nothing save untenanted space
and viewless first-beginnings. For on whatever side you shall
first determine first bodies to be wanting, t'his side will be the
