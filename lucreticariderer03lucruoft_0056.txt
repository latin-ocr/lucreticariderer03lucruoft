11110οἀ3, the purple, and the 3001101 far the most brilliant of
00101113, 010 quite effaced3 from Which you may infer that the
shreds part with 011 their 0010111 before they come back to tho
secds of things.

Lastly sincc you admit that all bodies do not utter 0 voice
nor emit a 3111011, for this reason you do not assign to all sounds
and smells. So also since we cannot perceive all things with
the eyes, you are 10 know that some things are as much denuded
of 0010111 03 0111013 010 without smell and devoid of sound‚ and
that the kcen-discerning mind can just as well apprehend these
things as it can take note of things which are destitute of other .
qualitieS.

But lest haply you suppose 11101 first bodies remain stripped
of 0010111· 010110, they are also wholly devoid of warmth and cold
and violent 11001, and 010 judged to be barren of sound and drained
of moisture, and emit from their body no scent of their own. Just
as when you set about preparing the balmy liquid of sweet mar-
joram and myrrh and 1110 flower of spikenard which gives forth
10 1110 nostrils a scent like nectar, before all you should seek‚
so far as you may and 0011 find it, the substance of scentless oil,
such 03 gives out no pei-sume 10 1110 110311113, that it may as little
as possible mcddle with and destroy by 113 own pungency the
odours mixed in its body and boiled up with 11; for the same
reason the first-beginnings of things must 1101 bring 10 1110 be·
getting of things 0 3111011 01 sound of their own, since they cannot
discharge anything from themselves, and for the same reason
no 10310 0111101 1101· cold nor any heat moderate 01 violent, and
the like. For 03 these things, be they what they may, are still
such as to be liable 10 death, whether pliant with 0 soft, brittle
with 0 crumbling, or hollow with 0 porcus body, they must all
be withdrawn from the first beginnings, if we wish to 0331811 10
things imperishable foundations for the whole sum of existence
to rest upon: that you may not have things returning altogether
to nothing.

To come to another point, whatever things we perceive to
have sense, you must yet admit to be all composed of senseless
first-beginnings: manifest tokens which are open to all to ap-
prehend, so far from refuting or contradicting this, do rather
themselves take us by the hand and constrain us to believe
