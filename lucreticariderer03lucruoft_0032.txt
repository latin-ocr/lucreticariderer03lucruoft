24 I 988—1027

Again if all the space of the whole sum were enclosed within
fixed box-ders and were bounded, in that case the store of matter
by its solid weights would have streamed together from all sides
to the lowest point nor could anything have gone on under the
canopy 01 heaven, no nor would there have been a heaven nor sun-
light at all, inasmuch as all matter, settling down through infinite
time past, would 110 together in a heap. But as it is, sure enough
no rest is given to the bodies of the first-beginnings‚ because there
is no lowest point at all, to which they might stream together as
it were, and where they might take up their positions. All things
are ever going on in ceaseless motion on all sides and bodies of
matter stirred to action are supplied from 1101103111 out of infinite
space. Therefore the nature ’01 100111 311(1 1110 space of the un-
fathomable void are such as bright thunderbolts cannot race through
111 111011 course though gliding on through endless tract of time,
no nor lessen one jot the journey that remains to go by all their
travel: so huge a 100111 15 spread out on all sides 101 things with-
out any bounds in 311 directions round.

Again nature keeps the sum of things from setting any limit to
itself, since she compels body to be ended by void and void in turn
by body, so that either she thus renders the universe infinite by
this alternation of the two, or else the one of the two, in case the
other does not bound it, with its single nature stretches neverthe-
less immeasurably. [But void I have already proved to be infi-
nite3 therefore matter must be infinite: for if void were infinite,
and matter finite] neither sea nor earth nor the glittering quarters
01 heaven nor mortal kind nor the holy bodies of the gods could
hold their ground one brief passing hour3 511100 forced asunder
from its union the 51010 01 matter would be dissolved and borne
along the mighty void, or rather I should say would never have
combined to produce any thing. since scattered abroad it could
never have been brought together. For verily not by design did
the first-beginnings of things station themselves 03011111 115 right
place guided by keen intelligence, nor did they bargain sooth to
say what motions each should assume, but because many in num-
ber and shifting about in many ways throughout the universe they
are drixLen-and tormented by blows during infinite time past, after
trying motions and unions of every kind at length they fall into
