nearly concerns these questions, the existence of things which
we call idols of things: these, like films peeled off from the
surface of things, fly to and fro through the air, and do likewiseJ
frighten our minds when they present themselves to us awake
as well as in sleep, what time we behold strange shapes and
idols of the light-bereaved, which have often startled us in ap-
palling wise as we lay relaxed in sleep: this I will essay, that
we may not haply believe that souls break loose from Acheron
or that shades fly about among the living or that something of us
is left behind after death, when the body and the nature of the
mind destroyed together have taken their departure into their
several first-beginnings.

I say then that pictures of things and thin shapes are emitted
from things off their surface, to which an image serves as a kind
of film, or name it if you like a rind, because such image bears
an appearance and form like to the thing whatever it is from
whose body it is shed and wanders forth. This you may learn
however dull of apprehension from what follows. First of all
since among things open to sight many emit bodies, some in a
state of loose diffusion, like smoke which logs of oak, heat which
fires emit; some of a closer and denser texture, like the gossamer
coats which at times cicades doff in summer, and the films which
calves at their birth cast from the surface of their body, as well as
the vesture which the slippery serpent puts off among the thorns;
for often we see the brambles enriched with their flying spoils:
since these cases occur, a thin image likewise must be emitted
from things off their surface. For why those films should drop
off and withdraw from things rather than films which are really
thin, not one tittle of proof can be given3 especially since there
are on the surface of things many minute bodies which may be
discharged in the same order they had before and preserve the
outline of the shape, and be discharged with far more velocity‚
inasmuch as they are less liable to get hampered being few in
number and stationed in the front rank. For without doubt we
see many things discharge and freely give not only from the core
and centre, as we said before, but from their surfaees, besides
other things colour itself. And this is commonly done by yellow
and red and dark-blue awnings, when they are spread over large
theatres and flutter and wave as they stretch across their poles
