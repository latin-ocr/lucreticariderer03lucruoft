infirmitieS, and by its contact with it the mind suffering many
ills. Nevertheless be it ever so expedient for them to make
a body, when they are going to enter, yet clearly there is no
way by which they can do so. Therefore souls do not make for
themselves bodies and limbs3 no nor can they by any method
find their way into bodies after they are fully formed; for they
will neither be able to unite themselves with a nice precision
nor will any connexion of mutual sensation be formed between
them.

Again why does untamed fierceness go along with the sullen
brood of lions, cunning with foxes and proneness to ssight with
stags? and to take any other instance of the kind, why are all
qualities engendered in the limbs and temper from the very com-
mencement of life, if not because a fixed power of mind derived
from its proper seed and breed grows up together with the whole
body? If it were immortal and wont to pass into different bodies,
living creatures would be of interchangeable dispositions3 a dog
of Hyrcanian breed would often fly before the attack of an antlered
stag, a hawk would cower in mid air as it fied at the approach of
a dove, men would be without reason, the savage races of wilsl
beasts would have reason. For the assertion that an immortal
soul is altered by a change of body is advanced on a false prin-
ciple. What is changed is dissolved, and therefore dies: the
parts are transposed and quit their former order3 therefore
they must admit of being dissolved too throughout the frame, in
order at last to die one and all together with the body. But
if they shall say that souls of men always go into human bodies,
I yet will ask how it is a soul can change from wise to foolish,
and no child has discretion, and why the mare's foal is not so
well trained as the powerful strength of the horse. You may
be sure they will fiy to the subterfuge that the mind grows
weakly in a weakly body. But granting this is so, you must
admit the soul to be mortal, since changed so completely through-
out the frame it loses its former life and sense. Then too in
what way will it be able to grow in strength uniformly with its
allotted body and reach the coveted flower of age, unless it shall
be its partner at its first beginning? or what means it by passing
out from the limbs when decayed with age? does it fear to re-
main shut up in a crumbliug body, sear that its tenement, worn
