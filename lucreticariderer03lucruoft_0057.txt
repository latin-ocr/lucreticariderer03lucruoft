that, as I say, living things are begotten from senseless things.
We may see in fact living worms spring out of stinking dung,
when the soaked earth has gotten putridity after excessive rains3
and all things besides change in the same way: rivers leaves

and glad pastures change into cattle, cattle change their sub-
stance into our bodies, and often out of these the powers of wild
beasts and the bodies of the strong of 'wing are increased.
Therefore nature changes all foods into living bodies and engen-
ders out of them all the senses of living creatures, much in the
same way as she dissolves dry woods into flames and converts
all things into fircs. Now do you see that it 15 of great moment
in what sort of arrangement the first-beginnings of things are
severally placed and with what others they are mixed up, when
they impart and receive motions?

Then again what is that which strikes your mind, affects
that mind and constrains it 10 give utterance to many dif-
ferent thoughts, to save you from believing that the sensible
is begotten out of senseless things? Sure enough it is because
stones and wood and earth however mixed together are yet
unable to produce vital sense. This therefore it will be well to
remember herem, that Ι do not assert that the sensible and
scnsations are forthwith begotten out of all elements without
exception which produce things3 but that it is of great moment
first how minute the particles are which make up the sensible
thing and then what shape they possess and what in short they
are in their motions arrangements and positions. None of which
conditions we find in woods and clods3 and yet even these
when they have so to speak become rotten through the rains,
bring forth wormS, because bodies of matter driven from their
ancient arrangements by a new condition are combined in the
manner needed for the begetting of living creatures. Next
they who hold that the sensible can be produced out of sen-
sible elements, accustomed thus to derive their own sense from
elements [which are sensible] in their turn, [do thus render their
own seeds mortaL] when they make them soft3 for all sense is bound
up with flesh sinews and veins; which in everything we 566 10
be soft and formed of a mortal body. But even suppose that these
things can remain eternal: they must yet I presume either have
the sense of some part or else be deemed to possess a sense
