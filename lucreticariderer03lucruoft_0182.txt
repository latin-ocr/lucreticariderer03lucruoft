monthly discharges. And many things besides relax through all
the frame the sainting limbs and shake the soul 111 its scats within.
Then too if you linger long in the hot baths when you arc some-
what full and do bathe, how liable you are to tumble down in a fit
while scatcd in the midst of the hot water! Again how readily
do the oppressive power and fumes of charcoal make their way
into the hrain, if we have not first taken water! But when burn-
ing Violently it has filled the chambers of a house, the fumes of
the virulent substance act on the ncrves like a murdcrous blow.
See you not too that even within the earth sulphur is gcnerated
and asphalt forms imrustaticms of a 1101501110 steneli? 500 you not,
when they arc following up the veins of silvcr and gold and
searching with the pick quite into the bowels of the carth, what
stenches Scaptensula exbales from below? Then what mischief
do gold mines exhale! to what state do they reduce men's 'faces
and what a complexion they produce! Know you not by sight or
hearsay how they commonly perish in a short time and how all
vital power fails those whom the hard compulsion of necessity con-

earth steams forth and breathes out into the open air and light of
heaven.

Thus too the Avernian spots must send up 501110 power deadly

the unseen poison and 50 palsied that it tumbles plump down on
the spot where this exhalation has its course. And when it falls
into it, then the same power of that exhalation robs all its limbs
of the remnants of life: first of all it causes a sort of dizziness3 but
afterwards, when the birds have tumbled into the very springs of
the poison, then life too has to be vomited forth, because all round
rises up large store of mischievous matter.

Sometimes too this power and exhalation of Avernus dispels
whatever air lies between the birds and carth, 50 that almost a
void is left there. And when the birds have arrived in their
flight just opposite this spot, at once the buoyant force of their
pinions is crippled and rendered vain and all the sustaining efforts
of their wings are lost on both sides. So when they are unable to
