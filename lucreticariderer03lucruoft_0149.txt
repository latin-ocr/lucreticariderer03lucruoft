nor suffer harm3 and asked for indulgence to children and
womankind, when with eries and gestures they declared in stam-
mering speech that meet it is for all to have mercy on the
weak. And though harmony could not be established without
exception, yet a very large portion observed their agreements
with good faith, or else the race of man would then have been
wholly cut off, nor could breeding have continued their genera-
- tions to this day.

But nature impelled them to utter the various sounds of the
tongue and use struck out the names of things, much in the same
way as the inability to speak is seen in its turn to drive children
to the use of gestures, when it forces them to point with the
finger at the things which are before them. For every one feels
how far he can make use of his peculiar powers. Ere the horns
of a calf are formed and project from his forehead, he butts with
it when angry and pushes out in his rage. Then whelps of
panthers and cubs of lions fight with claws and feet and teeth
at a time when teeth and claws are hardly yet formed. Again
we see every kind of fowl trust to wings and seek from pinions a
fluttering succourffx'Therefore to suppose that some one man at
that time apportioned names to things and that men from him
learnt their first words, is sheer follyb For why should this parti-
cular man be able to denote all things by words and to utter the
various sounds of the tongue, and yet at the same time others be
supposed not to have been able to do so? Again if others as well

as he had not made use of words among themselves, whence was

implanted in this man the previous conception of its use and
whence was given to him the original faculty, to know and per-
ceive in mind what he wanted to do? Again one man could not
constrain and subdue and force many to choose to learn the
names of things. It is no easy thing in any way to teach and
convince the deaf of what is needful to be done3 for they never
would suffer nor in any way endure sounds of voice hitherto
unheard to continue to be dinned fruitlessly into their ears.
Lastly what is there so passing strange in this circumstance, that
the race of men whose voice and tongue were in full force, should
denote things by different words as different *feelingsfl-prompted?
since (lumb brutes, yes and the races of wild beasts are accus-
tomed to give forth distinct and varied sounds, when they have
