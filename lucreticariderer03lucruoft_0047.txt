to consist more of smooth and round elements3 for the several
drops have no mutual cohesion and their onward course too has
a ready flow downwards. All things lastly which you see disperse
themselves iu an instant, as smoke mists and flames, if they do
not consist entirely of smooth and round, must yet not be held
fast by closely tangled elements‚ so that they may be able to
pieroe the body and enter it with biting power, yet not stick
together: thus you may easily know, that whatever we see the
senses have been able to allay, consists not of tangled but of
pointed elements. Do not however hold it to be wonderful that
some things which are fluid you see to be likewise bitter, for
instance the sea's moisture: because it is fluid, it consists of
smooth and round particles‚ and many rough bodies mixed up
with these produce pains3 and yet they must not be hooked so
as to hold together: you are to know that though rough, they
are yet spherical, so that while they roll freely on, they may at
the same time hurt the senses. And that you may more readily
believe that with sniooth are mixed rough first-beginnings from
which Neptune's body is made bitter‚ there is a way of separating
these, and of seeing how the fresh water, when it is often filtered
through the earth, flows by itself into a trench and sweetens; for
it leaves above the first-beginnings of the nauseous saltness‚ inas-
much as the rough partioles can more readily stay behind in the
earth.

And now that I have shewn this, Ι will go on to link to it a
truth which depends on this and from this draws its proof: the
first-beginnings of things have different shapeS, but the number of
shapes is finite. If this were not so, then once more it would
follow that some seeds must be of infinite bulk of body. For in the
same seed, in the single small size of any first body you like the
shapes cannot vary much from one another: say for instance that
first bodies consist of three least parts, or augment them by a few
more ; when to wit in all possible ways, by placing each in turn at
the top and at the bottom‚ by making the right change places
with the left, you shall have tried all those parts of one first body
and found what manner of shape each different arrangement gives
to the whole of that body, if after all this haply you shall wish
still to vary the shapes, you will have to add other parts; it will
next follow that for like reasons the arrangement will require
