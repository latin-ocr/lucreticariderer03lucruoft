111 headlong haste, as if hurrying to bring help to a house on
fire: he yawns the moment he has reached the door of his
house, 01· sinks heavily into sleep and seeks forgetfuln'ess, or
even in haste goes back again to town. In this way each man
flies from himself, (but sels from whom, as you may be sure is
commonly the case, he cannot escape, clings to him in his own
despite) hates too himself, because he is sick and knows not the
cause of the malady; for if he could rightly see into this, relin-
quisbing all else each man would study to learn the nature of
things, since the point at stake is the condition for eternity, not
for one hour, in which mortals have to pass all the time which
remains for them to expect after death.

Once more what evil lust of life is this which constrains us
with such force to be so mightily troubled in doubts and dangers?
a sure term 01 1116 15 fixed for mortals, and death cannot be
shunned, but meet it we must. Moreover we are ever engaged,
ever involved in the same pursuits, and no new pleasure is
struck out by living on; but whilst what we crave 15 wanting,
it seems to transcend all the rest; then, when it has been got-
ten, we orave something else, and ever does the same thirst 01
1116 possess us, 65 we gape for it open-mouthed. Quite doubtful
it is what fortune the future will carry with it or what chance
will bring us or what end is at hand. Nor by prolonging life
do we take one tittle from the time past in death nor can we
fret anything away, whereby we may haply be a less long time
in'the condition of the dead. Therefore you may complete as
many generations as you please during your life3 none the less
however will that everlasting death await you; and for no less
long a time will he be no more in being, who beginning with to-
day has ended his life, than the 111611 who has died many months
and years ago,
