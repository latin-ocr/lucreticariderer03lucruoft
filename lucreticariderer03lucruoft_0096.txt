many rays of light in a short time in order that all things may be
continually filled with it, so also for a like reason there must be
carried away from things in a moment of time idols of things
many in number in many ways in all directions 1·ound; since to
whatever part of them we present a mirror before their surfaces‚
other things correspond to these in the mirror of a like shape and
like colour. Moreover though the state of heaven has just before
been of unsullied purity, with exceeding suddenness it becomes so
hideously overcast, that you might imagine all its darkness had
abandoned Acheron throughout and filled up the great vaults of
heaven: in such numbers do faces of black horror rise up from
amid the frightful night of stormclouds and hang over us on high.
Now there is no one who can tell how small a fraction of these an
image is, or express that sum in language.

Now mark: how swift the motion is with which idols are
borne along, and what velocity is assigned to them as they glide
through the air, so that but a short hour is spent on a joui-ney
through long space, whatever the spot towards which they go
with a movement of varied tendency, all this I will tell in
sweetly worded rather than in many verses3 as the short song
of the swan is better than the loud noise of cranes scattered
abroad amid the ethereal clouds of the south. First of all we
may very often observe that things which are light and made of
minute bodies are swift. Of this kind are the light of the
sun and its heat, because they are made of minute first things
which are knocked forward so to speak and do not hesitate to
pass through the space of air between, ever driven 011 by a
blow following behind3 for light on the instant is supplied by
fresh light and brightness goaded to shew its brightness 111 what
you might call an ever on-moving team. Therefore 111 like
manner idols must be able to scour in a moment of time through
space unspeakable, first because they are exceeding small and
there is a cause at their back to carry and impel them far for-
ward3 where moreover they move on with such winged light-
ness3 next because when emitted they are possessed of so rare
a texture, that they can readily pass through any things and
stream as it were through the space of air between. Again if
those minute bodies of things which are given out from the
inmost depths of these things, as the light and heat of the sun,
