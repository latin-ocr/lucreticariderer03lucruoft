then in the end to the lees of uttermost disorder, each man seek-

η l ing for himself empire and sovercignty. Next a portion of them

taught men to elect legal officers, and drcw up codes, to induce
men to obey the laws. For mankind, tired out with a life of
brute force, lay exhausted from its feuds3 and therefore the more
readily it submitted of its own 1100113111 10 laws and stringent
codes. For as each one moved by anger took measures to avenge
himself with more severity than is now permittcd by QQPE
lay-s, for this reason men grew siek of a life of brute force. Thence

„ sear of punishment mars the prizes of life; for violence and wrong

enclosc all who commit them in their 01031103 and do mostly recoil
on him from whom they began ; and it is not easy for him who by
his deeds transgresses the terms of the public peace to pass a tran· ’
quil and a peaceful existence. For though he eludes God and
man, yet h‘e cannot but feel a misgiving that his secret can be
kept for ever3 seeing that many by speaking in their dreams
or in the wanderings of disease have 01100 1νο are told betrayed
themselves and have disclosed their hidden deeds of evil and
their sins.

led to the performance of stated sacred rite,s rites now in 13311100
00 solemn occasions and 111 solemn places, from which even now
13 1100100101111 mortals a shuddering awe which raises new tem-
ples of the gods over the whole ealth and pgompts men to crowd
them on festive days, all this it is not so difficult to explain in
words. Even then in sooth 1110 races of mortal men would see
hin waking mind glorious forms, would see them in sleep of yet
„ more marvellous 31Ζο 01 body. To these then they would attribute
sense, because they seemed to move their limbs and to utter lofty

words suitable to their glorious aspect and surpassing powers.
And they would give them life everlasting‚ because their face
would ever appear before them and their form abide ; yes and yet'

without all this, because they would not believe that beings pos-
sessed of such powers could lightly be overcome by any force.
And they would believe them to be preeminent in bliss, because
none 01 them was ever troubled with the fear of death, and be-
cause at the same time 10310οΡ they would see them perform
many miracles, yet feel on their part no fatigue from the effort.
