the body becomes rarefied and the whole nature undermined3 and
this state is attended by pain. Food therefore is taken in order
to give support to the frame and recruit the strength by its
infusion, and to close up the open-mouthed craving for meat
throughout limbs and veins. The moisture too passes into all the
parts which 0311 for moisture3 and many accumulated bodies of
heat which cause a burning in our stomach, the approach of liquid
scatters and quenches as if they were fire, so that dry heat can
no longer pai-ch the frame. In this way then you see gasping
thirst is drenched out of our body, in this way the hungry craving
is satisfied.

Now how it comes to pass that we are able to step out when
we please‚ and how it is given us to move about our limbs, and
what cause 15 wont to push forward the great load of this our
body I will tell: do you take in my words. Ι say that idols of
walking first present themselves to our mind and strike on the
mind, as we said before: then the will arises3 for no one begins
to do anything‚ until his mind has first determined what it wills.
From the very fact that it determines such thing, there 15 an
image of that thing. XVhen therefore the mind bestirs itself in
such 3 way 35 to will to walk and step out, it strikes at the same
moment the force of the soul which 15 spread over the whole
body throughout the limbs and frame3 and this 15 easily done,
since the whole is held in close union with the mind. Next the
soul in its turn strikes the body, and thus the whole mass by
degrees 15 pushed on and sot in motion. Then again the body
becomes also rarefied, and the air, 35 you see its nature is, being
always so nimble in moving, comes and passes in great quantity
through the opened pores and is thus distributed into the most
minute parts of the body. In this way then by these two causes
acting in two ways the body like a ship is carried on by 53115 31101
wind. And herein it need not excite any surprise that such very
minute bodies can steer so great a body and turn about the
whole of this our load; for wind though fine with subtle body
drives and pushes on a large ship of large moving mass and one
hand directs it however great the speed at which it is going and
one rudder steers it to any point you like3 and by means of
blocks of pulleys and tread-wheels a machine stirs many things of
great weight and raises them up with slight effort.
