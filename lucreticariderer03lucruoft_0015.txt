strong enough to overpower the texture of each. A thing there-
fore never returns to nothing, but all things after disruption go
back into the first bodies of matter. Lastly rains die, when father
ether has tumbled them into the lap of mother earth3 but then
goodly crops spring up and boughs are green with leaves upon the
trees, trees themselves grow and are laden with fruit; by them in
turn our race and the race of wild beasts are fed, by them we see
glad towns teem with children and the leafy forests ring on all
sides with the song of new birds3 through them cattle wearied
with their load of fat lay their bodies down about the glad pas-
tures and the white milky stream pours from the distended udders ;
through them a new brood with weakly limbs frisks and gambols
over the soft grass, rapt in their young hearts with the pure new
milk. None of the things therefore which seem to be lost is
utterly lost, since nature replenishes one thing out of another and
does not suffer any thing to be begotten, before she has been re-
cruited by the death of some other.

Now mark me: since I have taught that things cannot be
born from nothing, cannot when begotten be brought back to
nothing, that you may not haply yet begin in any shape to
mistrust my words, because the first-beginnings of things can-
not be seen by the eyes take moreover this list of bodies which
you must yourself admit are in the number of things and cannot
be seen. First of all the force of the wind when aroused beats
on the harbours and whelms huge ships and scatters clouds3
sometimes in swift whirling eddy it scours the plains and straws
them with large trees and scourges the mountain summits with
forest-rending blasts: so fiercely does the wind rave with a shrill
howling and rage with threatening roar. Winds therefore sure
enough are unseen bodies which sweep the seas, the lands, ay
and the clouds of heaven, tormenting them and catching them
up in sudden whirls. On they stream and spread destruction
abroad in just the same way as the soft liquid nature of water,
when all at once it is borne along in an overflowing stream, and
a great downfall of water from the high hills augments it with
copious rains, flinging together fragments of forests and entire
trees; nor can the strong bridges sustain the sudden force of
coming water: in such wise turbid with much rain the river
dashes upon the piers with mighty force: makes havoc with loud
