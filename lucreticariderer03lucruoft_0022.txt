being. For we see that anything is more quickly destroyed than
again renewcd; and therefore that which the long, the infinite
‹luration os all bygone time had broken up demolished and de-
stroyed, could never be reproduced in all remaining time. But
now sure enough a fixed limit to their breaking has been set,
since we see each thing renewed, and at the same time definite
periods fixcd for things each after its kind to reach the flower of
their age. Moreover while the bodies of matter are most solid,
it may yet be explained in what way all things which are formed
soft, as aii-‘water earth fires, are so formed and by what force
they severally go on, since once for all there is void mixed up
in things. But on the other hand if the first-beginnings of things
be soft‚ it cannot be explained out of what enduring basalt and
iron can be produced3 for their whole nature will utterly lack
a first foundation to begin with. First-beginnings therefore are
strong in solid singleness, and by a denser combination of these
all things can be closely packed and exhibit enduring strength.
Again if no limit has been set to the breaking of bodies, never-
theless the several bodies which go to things must survive from
eternity up to the present time, not yet assailed by any danger.
But since they are possessed of a frail nature, it is not consistent
with this that they could have continued through eternity ha·
rassed through ages by countless blows. Again too since a limit of
growing and sustaining life has been assigned to things each after
its kind, and since by the laws of nature it stands decreed what
they can each do and what they cannot do, and since nothing is
changed, but all things are so constant that the different birds
all in succession exhibit in their body the distinctive marks of
their kind, they must sure enough have a body of unchangeable
matter also. For if the first-beginnings of things could in any
way be vanquished and changed, it would then be uncertain too
what could and what could not rise into being, in short on what
principle each thing has its powers defined, its deep-set boundary
mark3 nor could the generations reproduce so often each after its
kind the nature habits, way of life and motions of the parents.
Then again since there is ever a bounding point [to bodies,
which appears to us to be a least, there ought in the same way to
be a bounding point the least conceivable] to that first body which
already is beyond what our senses can perceive: that point sure
