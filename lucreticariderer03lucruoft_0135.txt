itself out apart with its unmixed water, and likewise let the fires
of ether spread apart pure and unmixed.

For first the several bodies of earth, because they were heavy
and closely entangled‚ met together in the middle and took up all
of them the lowest positions3 and the more they got entangled
and the closer their union‚ the more they squeezed out those par-
ticles which were to make up sea stars sun and moon and the walls
of the great world. All these are of smooth and round seeds and
of much smaller elements than the earth. Therefore the fire-
laden ether first burst out from the different parts of the earth
through all the porous openings and lightly bore off with itself
many fires3 much in the same way as we often see, so soon as the
morning light of the beaming sun blushes golden over the grass
jewelled with dew, and the 110015 and the ever-running rivers
exhale a mist, and even as the earth itself is sometimes seen to
smoke3 and when all these are gathered together alost, then do
clouds on high with a now cohering body weave a covering beneath
heaven, In this way therefore then the light and expansive ether
with its now cohering body swept round and arched itself on 311
sides and expanding widely in all directions round in this way
fenced all other things in with its greedy grasp. After it followed
the rudiments of sun and moon, whose spheres turn round in air
midway between earth and ether: these neither earth 1135 taken
unto itself nor greatest ether, because they were neither heavy
enough to sink and settle down nor light enough to glide along
the uppermost borders; they yet however are 50 placed between
the two as to wheel along their life-like bodies and still to be
parts of the whole world ; just as in us some members may be at
rest, while others at the same time are in motion. These things
then being withdrawn, the earth in those parts where the vast
azure level of ocean now spreadS, in a moment sank in and
drenched with salt flood the hollows. At every day the more the
heats of ether round and the rays of the sun on all sides compressed
the earth into 3 01050 mass by oft—repeated blows on all its outer
edgeS, so 11131 111115 buffeted it was condensed and drawn together
about its centre, ever the more did the salt sweat squeezed out
of its body increase by its oozings the sea and floating fields‚ and
ever the more did those many bodies of heat and air escape and
fly abroad and condense far away from earth the high glittering
