time of year go by the name of etesian winds. elon-ing up the
river they retard it and driving the waters backwards fill its
ehannel full and force the river 10 stand still ; for beyond a doubt
111050 blasts which start from the icy 0011510110110115 of the pole are
carried right up the stream. That river 0011105 from the south
out of the heat-fraught country, rising far up from the centra]
region of day among races of men black in their sun-baked com-
plexion. It is quite possible too that 1110 great accumulation of
sand may bar up the mouths against the opposing waves, when
the sea stirred up by the winds throws up the sand within the
channel3 whereby the outlct of the river is rendered less free and
the current of 1110 waters at the same time less rapid in its down-
ward flow. It may be also that 1110 1111115 arc more frequent at
115 source in that season, because the etesian blasts of the north
winds drive all the clouds together into those parts at that time.
And, you are to know, when they have been driven on to the
central region of day and have gathered together, then 1110 clouds
ι111111111οᾶ 01050 against the high mountains are massed together and
vio]ently compressed. Perhaps too it gets its increase high up
s rom the lofty mountains of the Ethiopians, when the all-surveying
sun with his thawing rays consti-ains the white snows 10 descend
11110 1110 plains.

Now mark, and I will make clear to you what kind of nature
the several Avernian places and lakes possess. First of all, as to
the name Avernian by which they are called, it 1105 been given to
them from their real nature, because they are 11οΧ10115 10 all birds;
for when they have arrived in flight just opposite those spotS, they
finget to row with their wings they drop their sails and fall with
s‹›ft neck outstretched headlong to the earth, if so be that the na-
ture of the ground admit of that, or 11110 1110 water, if 50 be that a
lake of Avernus spreads below. There is such a spot at Cumae,
where the mountains are charged with acrid sulphur, and smoke
eni-iched with hot springs. Such a spot there also is within the
Athenian walls, on the very summit “of the eitadel‚ beside the
temple of bountiful Tritonian Pallas3 which croaking erows never .
001110 near on the wing3 110 1101 when the high altars smoke with
offerings: so constantly they fiy, not before the sharp wrath of
Pallas for the sake of yon vigil kept, 05 1110 poet-s of the Greeks
have sung, but the nature of the place suffices by its own proper
