enough is without parts and consists of a least nature and never
has existed apart by itself and will not be able in future so to
exist, since it is in itself a part of that other; and so a first and
single part and then other and other similar parts in succession fill up
in close serried mass the nature of the first body3 and since these
cannot exist by themselves, they must cleave to that from which
they cannot in any way be torn. First-beginnings therefore are of
solid singleness, massed together and cohering closely by means of
least parts, not compounded out of a union of those parts, but,
rather, strong in everlasting singleness. From them nature allows
nothing to be torn, nothing further to be worn away, reserving
them as secds for things. Again unless there shall be a least, the

very sinallest bodies will consist of infinite parts, inasmuch as the
half of the half will always have a half and nothing will set bounds

to the division. Therefore between the sum of things and the
least of things what difference will there be? There will be no
distinction at all 3 for how absolutely infinite soever the whole sum
is, yet the things which are smallest will equally consist of infinite
parts. Now since on this head true reason protests and denies
that the mind can believe it, you must yield and admit that there
exist such things as are possessed of no parts and are of a least
nature. And since these exist, those first bodies also you must
admit to be solid and everlasting. Once more, if nature creatress
of things had been wont to compel all things to be broken up into
least parts, then too she would be unable to reproduce anything
out of those parts, because those things which are enriched with
no parts cannot have the properties which begetting matter ought
to have, I mean the various entanglements weights blows clashings
motions, by means of which things severally go on.

For which reasons they who have held fire to be the matter of
things and the sum to be formed out of fire alone, are seen to have
strayed most widely from true reason. At the head of whom
enters Heraclitus to do battle, famous for obscurity more among
the frivolous than the earnest Greeks who seek the truth. For
fools admire and like all things the more which they pcrceive to
be concealed under involved language, and determine things to be
true which can prettily tickle the ears and are varnished over
with finely sounding phrase.

For I want to know how things can be so various, if they are
