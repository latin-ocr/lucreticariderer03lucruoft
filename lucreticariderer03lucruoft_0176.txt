Again when the wind gathering itself together in the hollow
places underground bears down on one point and pushing 011
presses with great violence the deep 00101115, 1110 earth leans over
on the side to which the hcadlong 1111101100 of the wind presses.
Τ11011 all buildings which arc above ground, and ever the more,
1110 111010 they tower up towards heaven, lean over and bulge out
yielding in the same direction‚ and the timbers wrenched from
111011· supports hang over ready to give way. And yet men shrink
from believing that a time of destruction and ruin awaits the
nature of the great world, though they 500 50 great a mass of earth
hang· ready to fall 1 And if the winds· did not abate their blowing,
no force could rein things in or hold them up on their road to
destruction. As it is, because by turns they do abate and then
increase in violence, and 50 10 spoak rally and return to the charge,
and then are defeated and retire, for this reason the earth oftener

fixed position. For this reason the whole house rocks, the top
more than the middle, the middle than the bottom‚ the bottom in
a very very slight degree.

The same great quaking likewise arises from this cause, when
011 a sudden the wind and 501110 enormous force of air gathering
either from without or within the earth have flung themselves
into the hollows of the earth, and there chafe at first with much
uproar among the great caverns and are carried on with a whirling
motion, and when their force afterwards stirred and lashed into
fury bursts abroad and at the same moment cleaves the deep
earth and opens up a great yawning 01105111. Τ1115 fell out in
Syrian Sidon and took place at Aegium in the Peloponnese‚ two
towns which an outbreak of wind of this sort and the ensuing
earthquake threw down. And many walled places besides fell
down by great commotions on land and many towns sank down
engulphed in the sea together with their burghers. And if they
do not break out, still the impetuous fury of the air and the fierce
violence of the wind spread over the numerous passages of the
earth like a shivering-fit and-thereby cause a trembling3 just as
