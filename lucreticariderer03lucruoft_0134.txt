things. Thus to wit have the old poets of the Greeks sung;
though it is all too widely at variance with true reason. Fire may
gain the mastery when more bodies of matter than usual have
gathered themselves up out of the infinite3 and then its powers
decay, vanquished in some way or other, or else things perish
burnt up by the torrid air. XVater too of yore gathered itself and
began to get the mastery‚ as the story goes, when it whelmed
many citics of men; and then when all that force that had
gathered 115011Ί up out of the infinite, by some means or other was
turned aside and withdrew, the rains were stayed and the rivers
abated their fury.

But in what ways yon concourse of matter founded earth and
heaven and the deeps of the sea, the courses of the sun and moon,
I vwill next* in order describe. For verily not by design did the
first-beginnings of things station themselves each in its right place
by keen intelligence‚ nor did they bargain sooth to say what
motions each should assume, but because the first-beginnings of
things many in number in many ways impelled by blows for infi-
nite ages back and kept 111 motion by their own weights have been
wont to be carried along and to unite 111 all manner of ways and
thoroughly to test every kind of production possible by their
mutual combinations, therefore it is that spread abroad through
great time after trying unions and motions of every kind they at
length meet together in those masses which suddenly brought
together become often the rudiments of great things, of earth sea
and heaven and the race of living things.

At this time then neither could the sun’s disk be discerned
flying aloft with its abundant light, nor the stars of great ether,
nor sea nor heaven, no nor earth nor air, nor could any thing be
seen like to our things but only a strange stormy crisis and
medley‚ gathered together out of first-beginnings of every kind,
whose state of discord joining battle disordered their interspaces
passages connexions weights blows clashings and motions, because
by reason of their unlike forms and varied shapes they could not
all remain thus joined together nor fall into mutually harmonious
motions. Then next the several parts began to fly asunder and
things to be joined like with like and to mark off the world and
portion out its members and arrange its mighty parts, that is
to say, to separate high heaven from earth, and let the sea spread
