noise and rolls under its eddies huge stones: wherever aught
opposes its waves, down it dashes it. In this way then must the
blasts of wind as well move on, and when they like a mighty
stream have borne down in any direction, they push things be-
fore them and throw them down with repeated assaults, some·
times catch them up in curling eddy and carry them away in
swift-circling whirl. Wherefore once and again I say winds are
unseen bodies, since in their works and ways they are found to
rival great rivers which are of a visible body. Then again we per-
ceive the different smells of things, yet never see them coming to
our nostrils3 nor do we behold heats nor can wc obscrve cold with
the eyes nor are we used to see voices. Yet all these things must
consist of a bodily nature, since they are able to move the senses;
for nothing but body can touch and be touched. Again clothes
hung up on a shore which waves break upon become moist, and
then get dry if spread out in the sun. Yet it has not been seen
in what way the moisture of water has sunk into them nor again
in what way this has been dispelled by heat. The moisture there-
fore is dispersed into small particles which the eyes are quite unable
to see. Again after the revolution of many of the sun's years a ring
on the finger is thinned on the under side by wearing, the drip-
ping from the eaves hollows a stone, the bent ploughshare of iron
imperceptibly dccreases in the fieldS‚ and we behold the stone—
pavcd streets worn down by the feet of the multitude; the brass
statues too at the gates shew their right hands to be wasted by
the touch of the numerous passers by who greet them. These
things then we sce are lessened‚ since they have been thus worn
d0wn3 but what bodies depart at any given time the nature of
vision has jealously shut out our seeing. Lastly the bodies which
time and nature add to things by little and little, constraining
them to grow in due measure, no exertion of the eyesight can
behold; and so too wherever things grow old by age and decay,
and when rocks hanging over the sea are eaten away by the
gnawing salt spray, you cannot see what they lose at any given
moment. Nature therefore works by unseen bodies.

And yet all things are not on all sides jammed together and
kept in by body: there is also void in things. To have learned
this will be good for you on many accounts3 it will not suffer
you to wander in doubt and be to seek in the sum of things and
