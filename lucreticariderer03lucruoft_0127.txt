113-157 v V 119

I will clearly set forth to you many comforting topics in learned
language, lest held in the yoke of religion you haply suppose that
earth and sun and heaven, sea stars and moon must last for ever
with divine body, and therefore think it right that they after the
fashion of the giants should all suffer punishment for their mon-
§trous guilt, who by their reasoning displace the walls of the world
and seek to quench the glorious sun of heaven, branding immortal
things in mortal speech3 though in truth these things are so far
from posses-sing divinity and are so unworthy of being reckoned in
the number of gods that they may be thought to afford a notable
instance of what is quite without vital motion and sense. For it
is quite impossible to suppose that the nature and judgment
of the mind can exist with any body whatever3 even as a tree
cannot exist in the ether nor clouds in the salt sea, nor can fishes
live in the fields nor blood exist in woods nor sap in stones. Where
each thing ean grow and abide is fixed and ordained. Thus the
nature of the mind cannot corne into being alone without the
body nor exist far away from the sinews and blood. But if (for
this would be much more likely to happen than that) the force
itself of the mind might be in the head or shoulders or heels or
might be born in any other part of the body, it would after all
be wont to abide in one and the same man or vessel. But since
in our body even it is fixed and seen to be ordained where the
soul and the mind can severally be and grow it must still more
strenuously be denied that it can abide out of the body and the
living form altogether in crumbling clods of earth or in the fire
of the sun or in water or in the high borders of ether. These
things therefore are not possessed of divine sense, since they can-
not be quickened with the vital feeling.

This too you may not possibly believe, that the holy seats
of the gods exist in any parts of the world: the fine nature of
the gods far withdrawn from our senses is hardly seen by the
thought of the mind3 and since it has ever eluded the touch and
stroke of the hands, it must touch nothing which is tangible for us;
for that cannot touch which does not admit of being touched in
turn. And therefore their seats as well must be unlike our seats,
fine, even as their bodies are fine. All which I will prove to you
later in copious argument. To say again that for the sake of men
they have willed to set in order the glorious nature of the world
