sceds which bound them. For this reason when that which is
sweet to some becomes bittcr to others, for that creature to whom
it is sweet the smoothest bodies must enter the cavities of the
palate with power to feel them all ovcr3 but on the other hand 111
the case of those to whom the same thing is bitter within, rough
and barbed seeds sure enough pass down the throat. It is easy
now from these principles to understand all particular cases: thus
when a sever has attacked any one from too great 3 flow of bile, or
a violent disease has been excited in any other way, thereupon the
whole body is disordered and all the arrangements of particles
then and there changed3 the consequence of which is that the
bodies which before were suited to excite sensation, suit no more;
and those fit it better, which are able to make their way in and
beget a bitter sense. Both kinds for instance are mixed up in the
flavour of honey: a point we havc often proved before.

Now mark me, and I will discuss the way in which the con·
tact of smell affects the nostrils: and first there must be many
things from which a varied flow of smells streams and rolls on3
and we must suppose that they thus stream and discharge and
disperse themselves among all things alike3 but one smell fits
itself better to one creature, another 10 another on account of
their unlike shapes3 and therefore bees are drawn on by the
smell of honey through the air to a very great distance, and
so are vultures by cai-cases. Also the onward-reaching power
of scent in dogs leads them whithcrsoever the cloven hoof of
wild beasts has carried them in their course3 and the smell of
man is felt far away by the saviour of the Romans’ citadel, the
bright white goose. Thus different scents assigned to different
creatures led each to its appropriate food and constrain them
to recoil from naus-eous poison, and in this way the races of beasts
are preserved.

Of all these different 51115115 then which strike the nostrils
one may reach to a much greater distance than another3 though
none of them is carried so far as sound, 35 voice, to say nothing
of things which strike the eyesight and provoke vision. For in
its mazy course each comes slowly on and is sooner lost, being
gradually dispersed into the readily receiving expanse of air ;
first because coming out of its depths it with difficulty discharges
itself from the thing: for the fact that all things are found to
