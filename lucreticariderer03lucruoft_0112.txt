the weakness, with a lively apprehension to avoid the mistake
of supposing that the bright lights of the eyes were made in order
that we might 500; and that the tapering ends of the shanks and
hams are attached to the feet as a base in order to enable us to
step out with long strides; or again that the forearrns were slung ·
to the stout upper arms and minister-ing hands given us on each
side, that we might be able to discharge the needful duties of
life. Other explanations of like sort which men give, one and all
put effect for cause through wrongheaded reasoning3 since nothing
was born in the body that we might use it, but that which is born
begets for itself a use: thus seeing did not exist before the eyes
were bornknor the employment of speech ere the tongue was
made3 but rather the birth of the tongue was long anterior to
language and the ears were made long before sound was heard,
and all the limbs, I trow, existed before there was any employ-
ment for them: they could not therefore have grown for the pur-
pose of being used. But on the other hand engaging in the strife
of battle and mangling the body and staining the limbs with gore
were in vogue long before glittering dai-ts ever flew3 and nature
prompted to shun a wound or ever the left arm by the help of
art held up before the person the defence of a shield. Yes and
consigning the tired body to rest is much older than a soft-
cushioned bed, and the slaking of thirst had birth before cups.
These things therefore which have been invented in accordance
with the uses and wants of life, may well be believed to have
been discovered for the purpose of being used. Far otherwise is
it with 311 those things which first were born, then afterwards
made known the purposes to which they might be put; at the
head of which class we see the senses and the limbs. Wherefore
again and again I repeat, it is quite impossible to believe that
they could have been made for the duties which they discharge.

It ought likewise to cause 110 wonder that the nature of the
body of each living creature absolutely requires food. Ι have
shewn that bodies ebb away and withdraw from things, many in
number in many ways3 but most numerous must be those which
withdraw from living things3 for because these are tried by active
motion, and many particles are pressed out from the depths of
the frame and carried off by sweating, many breathed out through
the mouth, when they pant from exhaustion, from such causes
