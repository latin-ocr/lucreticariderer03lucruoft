by reasoning or prove by words, since so many things can be born
in such a regular succession. Spring and Venus go their way,
and tho winged hai-binger of Venus steps on before; and close on
Zephyr's footprints mother Flora straws all the way before them
and covers it over with the choicest colours and odours. Next in
order follows parching heat, and in its company dusty Ceres and
the etesian blasts of the north winds. Next autumn advances and
Euhius Euan steps on together. Then other seasons and winds
follow, loud-roaring Volturnus and the southwind stored with
lightning. At last midwinter brings with it snows and gives back
benumbing cold; after it follows winter with teeth chattering with
cold. It is therefore the less strange that a moon is begotten at
a fixed time and at a fixed time is destroyed again, since many
things may take place at a time so surely fixed.

The eclipses of the sun likewise and the obscurations of the
moon you may suppose to take place from many different causes.
For why should the moon be able to shut the earth out from the
sun's light and on the earthward side put in his way her high-
exalted head, placing her dark orb before his burning rays3 and
yet at the same time it be thought that another body gliding
on ever without light cannot do the same‘.2 Why too should not
the sun be able, quite exhausted‚ to lose his fires at a fixed time,
and again reproduce his light when in his journey through the air
he has passed by spots fatal to his flames, which cause his fires to
be quenched and to perish? And why should the earth be able
in turn to rob the moon of light and moreover herself to keep the
sun suppresse& while in her monthly course she glides through
the well-defined shadows of the cone3 and yet at the same time
another body not be able to pass under the moon or glide above
the sun's orb, breaking off its rays and the light it sheds forth?
Yes and if the moon shines with her own brightness, why should
she not be able to grow faint in a certain part of the world, while
she is passing through spots hostile to her own light 2

And now further since I have explained in what way every
thing might take place throughout the blue of the great heaven;
how we might know what force and cause set in motion the
varied courses of the sun and wanderings of the moon3 and in
what way their light might be intercepted and they be lost to
us and spread darkness over the earth little expecting it, when
